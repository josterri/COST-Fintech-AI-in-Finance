Title:
Sustainable Digital Transformation in Europe
Acronym:
DigitalTransform
Summary
With 38 COST countries and 187 proposers, the Action is a strategically designed initiative targeting the
transformation of the European finance sector into a more sustainable and digitally advanced landscape,
with the ultimate goal of enhancing Europe&#x27;s global competitiveness. This is a European task and can only
be achieved with the help of a COST network.
The work plan for transforming the European finance sector is organized into four Working Groups (WGs).
WG1 focuses on data-driven processes and data privacy, employing methods like differential privacy and
federated learning to create comprehensive guidelines. Building on that, WG2 employs Generative AI for
several finance areas. WG3 will make AI in finance more transparent and accountable, while WG4 will
advance sustainable finance through data-driven ESG measurements.
The Action will have a multi-faceted impact across scientific, technological, and socioeconomic domains in
Europe and has outlined specific deliverables, including comprehensive reports, models, and algorithms, to
be achieved within the 48-month time frame. It also identifies potential risks, such as inconsistency in data
privacy regulations and limited adoption of XAI protocols, and provides contingency plans for each.
The network will be interdisciplinary, involving professionals from finance, law, ethics, and computer
sciences. The Action aligns with key strategic priorities like the European Green Deal and the Digital Finance
Package. It places a strong focus on young researchers and will engage stakeholders from various
disciplines. Overall, the Action will provide actionable solutions to complex challenges in the financial sector,
ensuring its research is grounded in real-world applications and policy landscapes.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
1. S&amp;T EXCELLENCE
1.1 SOUNDNESS OF THE CHALLENGE
1.1.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART
The Action will develop a research framework that will address the key challenges associated with
integrating cutting-edge digital technologies in the finance sector. In achieving this aim, the Action will
drive forward the digitalization of finance while ensuring that core policy objectives, such as consumer
and investor protection, fair competition and stability continue to be met as the digital transformation of
the financial sector continues.
In recent years, we have seen the emergence of new technologies, products and business models at
an unprecedented speed, all summarised under the label Digital Finance. The digitalisation of the
financial industry holds great promise. It offers the opportunity to make quick and cost-effective
payments, enable the development of innovative financial products and services and foster wider
access to financial services thus incorporating previously “unbanked” areas. Put simply, digital
technologies are expected to fundamentally transform the financial service industry. Some
examples of the practitioners’ perspective in terms of the topic’s relevance come from an extensive
analysis done by the World Economic Forum (WEF) (2020), which provides a comprehensive picture
of how digital technologies are applied in financial services by both incumbents and Fintechs. The
study finds that:
●
77% of practitioners anticipate innovative technologies to possess high or very high overall
importance to their businesses in the future
●
Approximately 64% of practitioners anticipate employing innovative digital technologies in all
of the following categories – generating new revenue potential through new products and
processes, process automation, risk management, customer service and client acquisition
●
Overwhelmingly, practitioners expect that digital technologies will become a key success
factor for specific financial service sectors
Despite promises, the fast adoption of innovative technologies in finance poses challenges and risks,
encompassing legal issues like disclosure and oversight, technology-related concerns such as poor
data quality, protection and privacy, lack of sufficient explainability, algorithmic bias, and inconsistency
in ESG assessment. The European Commission has taken steps in addressing some challenges
through GDPR, the AI strategy (European Commission., 2023), and the digital finance package
(European Commission., 2020b). These issues align with UN Sustainable Development Goals
(Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Sustainable Development, 2023) and are increasingly
relevant for financial service companies, as per the 2020 WEF study. To this point, the study done by
WEF (2020) finds that:
●
91% of the surveyed practitioners consider data quality issues to be a key hurdle to deploying
innovative digital technologies like machine learning in practice
●
64% of practitioners consider deficits in trust and user adoption to be another major hindrance
of the adoption of digital technologies in finance
●
Complex models are often developed and evaluated within closed environments which do not
match the conditions of real-world applications
●
Firms are particularly wary of the potential for complex models to entrench biases in
decision-making
Having
in
mind
this
gap
between
the
theoretical
capabilities
of
technology
and its actual
implementation in real-world scenarios, the Action will develop a research framework that addresses
the key technology-related huddles of implementing state-of-art technologies in finance applications
and enable the transition to a digital finance ecosystem that is sustainable, transparent and inclusive.
Specifically, the action will: (i) bolster the EU&#x27;s digital data market by enhancing data quality, protection
and privacy; (ii) establish clear guidelines for integrating generative AI in finance by developing
innovative solutions for risk management, market trend prediction, and personalized financial products
that take into consideration challenges related to data security, ethical considerations and regulatory
compliance; (iii) develop domain-driven XAI solutions for the finance sector by solving some of the key
challenges of deploying explainability to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied
to financial use cases; and (iv) propose data-driven ESG scoring methods.
As a result, the Action’s research framework will lead to more, better, and more inclusive
ﬁnancial innovations that accelerate the digital and green transition of Europe, in line with
Europe’s key strategic priorities such as the development of key digital, enabling and emerging
technologies (DG Research and Innovation, 2021), the European Green Deal, the Digital Finance
Package and the European Approach to AI (European Commission 2023).

We elaborate in more detail on the four key technology-related pillars of the future function of finance,
which in turn define the research objectives of the Action:
●
Ensuring data protection, privacy and fairness in financial data (WG1). The distinctive
trait of the emerging new financial ecosystem is the increasing availability of data. Data is in
the centre of the digital transformation and more is to come (EC, A European strategy for data,
2020). Both academia and industry are increasingly faced with data characterised with
staggeringly high number of dimensions, high variability and high veracity. Utilising such data
is accompanied by many challenges among which: How do we ensure that all dimensions
(accuracy, consistency, completeness, currency, volatility and timeliness) of data quality are
satisfied to a necessary extent? What are the key challenges and opportunities in developing
a unified data privacy framework, including clear definitions and methods, for ensuring the
security and compliance of financial applications through the integration of differential privacy
and federated learning techniques? What are the most effective methods and techniques for
assessing and mitigating biases in large financial datasets to achieve data fairness, and how
do these methods impact decision-making processes and outcomes in various finance use
cases?
●
Develop and deploy end-to-end use cases of generative AI&#x27;s applications in finance
(WG2). Generative AI holds transformative potential for the finance sector, offering capabilities
that span from the simulation of intricate financial scenarios and the creation of novel
investment strategies, to the generation of synthetic financial data for enhanced analytics. By
leveraging these models, financial institutions can potentially devise innovative solutions that
enhance risk management and portfolio optimization processes, predict market trends, and
offer personalized financial products tailored to individual consumer preferences. However, the
journey to integrate generative AI into finance is riddled with challenges: How can sensitive
ﬁnancial data be processed by generative AI models without risking unintentional disclosures?
What are the potential applications and limitations of large language models (LLM) in
predicting ﬁnancial market movements, and how can these models be effectively integrated
into existing ﬁnancial forecasting methodologies? How do we assess the suitability and
effectiveness of LLM in the speciﬁc applications of portfolio optimization and risk
management? How can the potential of generative AI be fully harnessed in the ﬁnance sector
while ensuring no compromises on security, ethics, or regulatory compliance?
●
Ensure explainability and fairness of AI-based systems in finance (WG3). In order to
address the “black box” challenge of AI solutions, the concept of eXplainable AI (XAI)
emerged, introducing a suite of techniques attempting to explain to users how complex
models arrived at certain decisions. For the most part, these techniques, introduced primarily
through academic efforts, are not tailored to ﬁnancial use cases and datasets and, as such,
their ability to bring forward robust and stable explanations concerning the inner-working of
complex models applied in ﬁnance, is limited. In this context, pending research questions are:
To what extent existing XAI tools address the explainability needs of different stakeholders
within
the
ﬁnancial
value
chain?
–How
can
we
build
XAI
methods that are not
perturbation-based and thus maintain the natural time ordering and dependence structures of
the data? How can we make sure that algorithmic systems do not yield socially-biassed
outcomes, thereby compounding inequalities? How can we deal with the persisting latency in
computing and showing explanations in real time? How can XAI platforms enhance ethics in
the use of AI predictive models and ensure compliance with GDPR?
●
Streamlining ESG assessment and reporting (WG4). Sustainable finance will have a key
role to play in the future function of finance as climate change and environmental degradation
are becoming an existential threat to Europe and the world (EC, European green deal, 2019).
As clearly stated in the European Green Deal strategy, sustainable finance and investment will
be key to fostering sustainable global development. Though inevitable, transitioning to a
sustainable future with inclusive, green economies and resilient ecosystems is associated with
many challenges. With the Action, we will answer the following research questions: What are
the key components and methodological considerations in developing a real-time, data-driven
ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scoring model that integrates sentiment
analysis obtained through the utilisation of LLM? How can the resulting model be effectively
disseminated, either as an open-source tool or as a policy recommendation, to enhance
sustainability assessments and regulatory oversight in the financial sector? How do different
data-driven ESG measurement techniques, incorporating LLM for sentiment analysis and
news report analysis, compare in terms of accuracy, reliability, and suitability for assessing the
sustainability performance of organizations, and what are the implications for informed
decision-making by investors and stakeholders?

In this context, the Action will ensure that the European finance industry will stay globally competitive,
give
European
consumers
access to innovative financial products, while ensuring consumer
protection, financial stability and contribute to ESG and European Green Deal goals.
A research initiative aimed at overcoming the obstacles associated with AI deployment in finance
demands a transdisciplinary, gender-balanced, international research network with a strong
focus on young researchers and innovators for several compelling reasons. First, financial
systems are by design intricately interconnected and globally interdependent, influenced by an array of
factors that transcend national boundaries. Researchers from different regions bring valuable
perspectives to the table, shedding light on regional nuances and providing a comprehensive
understanding of the global financial landscape. Second, addressing these challenges goes beyond
the confines of single disciplines. It involves a blend of expertise from computer science, economics,
law, ethics, regulation, and cybersecurity. A transdisciplinary approach ensures that all aspects of the
problem are thoroughly explored and integrated into potential solutions. Thirdly, financial data is
diverse and subject to regional regulations. Collaboration on an international scale facilitates the
aggregation of heterogeneous datasets, addresses data privacy concerns, and establishes common
data standards crucial for the development and training of AI models. Fourth, financial regulations vary
across countries, and ethical considerations are essential. An international research network can
facilitate the exchange of regulatory insights and ethical best practices, ensuring that AI systems are
compliant with international standards. Lastly, collaboration on an international scale accelerates the
development of AI solutions for finance. By pooling resources, knowledge, and expertise from
researchers and institutions across Europe, collaborative efforts can drive innovation, leading to more
effective and globally applicable solutions.
1.1.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHALLENGE (MAIN AIM)
The Action will establish a cross-border network of professionals across finance, mathematics,
statistics, computer sciences, law and ethics, focusing on solving the main hurdles of integrating AI
systems into the different functions of finance. The main goal is to develop a collaborative platform that
derives
AI-driven,
robust,
explainable
and
sustainable
systems
that
will
support
the
digital
transformation of finance. Currently, there exists a significant gap between the theoretical
possibilities of AI-based systems and the actual feasibility of implementing these capabilities
in real-world scenarios in finance. While numerous researchers have established the effectiveness
of AI-based systems across diverse predictive tasks (Dingli and Fournier, 2017, Di Persio and
Honchar, 2017, Sen and Mehtab, 2021, Cao, 2022), there remains a critical need for research focused
on identifying (and addressing) the key barriers hindering their widespread adoption in real-world
financial use cases, thus leading to sustained and expansive impacts in Finance, ensuring a green
and digital transition. Specifically, through joint international efforts and interdisciplinary expertise, the
Action will address hurdles related with the different stages of building and deploying AI-based
systems. In order to ensure that all dimensions of data quality are satisfied, the COST action will:
develop a comprehensive data quality assessment framework, establish a unified data privacy
framework for financial applications, and identify effective methods for assessing and mitigating biases
in large financial datasets. Looking at the model deployment hurdles that industry is faced with, the
Action will: prototype and deploy end-to-end generative AI use cases in finance, propose guidelines for
sensitive financial data processing by AI models, introduce novel metrics for evaluating the utility of
LLM for financial market prediction, and run an assessment of their suitability for portfolio optimization
and risk management. For the purpose of bringing suitable level of explainability and trust into
deployed AI systems in finance, the Action will: evaluate existing XAI tools, propose novel
finance-specific XAI methods, train and test strategies for preventing socially-biassed outcomes in
AI-based risk management systems, and research into real-time solutions for reducing latency in AI
explanations. Finally, in order to ensure a data-driven assessment of sustainability, the Action will:
create a real-time, data-driven ESG scoring model integrating sentiment analysis, document methods
for effective dissemination (either as an open-source tool or policy recommendations), and conduct a
comparative analysis of data-driven ESG measurement techniques, including the utilization of LLM for
enhanced sustainability assessments and regulatory oversight in finance.
The ultimate goal of the Action is to blend diverse expertise that allows us to optimally use
high-dimensional data and state-of-art AI systems to push forward the digitalization of the functions of
finance. Emerging AI technologies, distinct from conventional methods, present clear benefits for the
financial sector. The effectiveness of these methods will be measured and contextualised in terms of
their practicality and challenges of real-world implementation. While the focus is on financial
applications, the outcomes will be applicable to wider fields, and efforts will be made to share insights
across different industry domains.

1.2 PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE OF THE ART
1.2.1 APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGE AND PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE OF THE ART
From a methodological perspective, the Action will focus on bringing forward several contributions to
the literature. In the context of ensuring data quality, privacy and protection, the Action will test
different state-of-art techniques proposed in the literature for tackling privacy issues in deep and
federated learning (FL). Particularly, we will focus on differential privacy (DP). The primary aim of
differential privacy (DP) is to enable the examination of dataset characteristics related to a population
as a whole, all while safeguarding individual privacy (Dwork, 2006, Dwork 2008, Ouadrhiri et al.,
2022). In simpler terms, DP involves introducing perturbations, either in statistical inquiries or the
original dataset, to prevent an adversary from determining whether a specific individual is part of the
dataset or not. This approach is considered a de facto standard for protecting users’ privacy in
statistical computations. The Action will run and compare several applications of DP for financial data
sets and time series. Moreover, the network will also tackle the challenges evolving in algorithmic bias.
Many financial services, such as mortgage or loan approvals, are algorithmically aided decisions.
Such techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods, are not inherently biassed
but often oblivious to sensitive parameters. This can be a result of bias introduced at any step in the
life cycle (Davidson et al., 2023) including, e.g., socio-historical bias in the data generation process,
Simpson’s Paradox as an example of aggregation bias (Prost et al., 2023) or the choice of
optimization functions, regularizations that can contribute to biassed algorithmic decisions. Within the
COST Action, researchers will explore a wide variety of methods to debias algorithmic solutions for
financial applications. Since many fair learning algorithms have already been implemented (like IBM
(2023) AI Fairness 360 toolkit), the researchers within COST will analyze the possibility of adjusting
and extending those methods for problems arising in the financial sector. Moreover, much of the
attention will be focused on developing new approaches to fight against bias both on the data and
methods side. On the algorithmic side, the researchers will investigate the approach based on
disparate learning processes (DLPs) that allows the sensitive attributes during the learning phase but
not during the prediction time (Lipton et al., 2018) or Variational Fair Autoencoder, which treats
protected attributes as the nuisance variables (Louizos, 2015). On the data debiasing side, a very
interesting approach is Fair Adversarial Networks (FairGAN), whose goal is to create synthetic data of
similar quality as real data, not discriminatory toward certain demographic groups (Wu, 2022).
Considering the application of generative AI in finance, the Action will develop end-to-end use cases
which will detail the entire pipeline of building AI-systems incorporating LLMs for financial applications.
LLM have been shown to be very effective on a variety of language tasks (information and knowledge
queries, analysing text data, generating briefs and reports) (Wu et al., 2023, Xie et al., 2023, Zhao et
al., 2023, Hadi et al., 2023). However, most of the implementations available in the literature do not
take into consideration the practical constraints (like regulatory compliance, scalability, privacy
concerns, etc.) in which the financial sector operates. To this end, the Action will assess the potential
and limitations of LLM for various financial applications (i.e. predicting financial markets, enhancing
risk management and portfolio optimization processes) and propose guidelines for effectively
integrating their outputs into classic methodologies for classification and prediction.
Furthermore, the Action will also aim at proposing solutions for the growing “trust” issues with complex
models. The introduction of complex ML and DL methods for financial use cases (i.e. time series
forecasting or credit scoring), potentially enables higher predictive accuracy but this comes at the cost
of higher complexity and thus lower interpretability (Hulsen, 2023),. ML models are referred to as
“black boxes” because it is often difficult to understand how variables are jointly related to arrive at a
certain output (Arrieta et al., 2019). This reduced ability to understand the inner workings and
mechanisms of complex models unavoidably affects their trustworthiness and the willingness among
practitioners to deploy such methods in sensitive domains such as finance. As a result, the scientific
interest in the field of eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has grown tremendously within the last
few years (Gunning et al., 2019, Linardatos et al., 2021, Dazeley et al., 2021 and Saeed and Omlin,
2023). XAI aims at introducing a suite of techniques attempting to communicate understandable
information about how an already developed model produces its predictions for any given input
(Arrieta et al., 2019). The growing popularity of the topic notwithstanding, research on XAI in finance
remains limited and most of the existing explainability techniques are not suited for financial data
which are characterised with dependence of features and non-stationarity. Many state-of-the-art XAI
methods are originally tailored for certain input types such as images (ex. Saliency Maps) or text (ex.
LRP) and have later been adjusted to suit tabular data as well. However, temporal dimensions and
features&#x27; dependence are often omitted, and the literature currently offers only a limited consideration
of the topic. Notable examples are interpretable decision trees for time series classification (Hidasi and
Gáspár-Papanek, 2011) and using attention mechanisms (Hsu et al., 2019, Schockaert, 2020) with
none of the applications looking specifically at explainability for financial data. To address this gap in

the literature as well as in the considered application field, the Action will focus on investigating the
utility of existing state-of-art XAI methods and proposing novel methods for financial applications.
Finally, the Action will also focus on tackling several methodological challenges related to the
sustainable
finance
domain.
Numerous
organisations
are assessing businesses&#x27; non-financial
endeavours by employing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics as assessment
criteria (Almeyda and Darmansya, 2019 and Bassen and Kovacs, 2020). Nevertheless, the reliability
of existing ESG ratings is constrained by variations in criteria among assessment bodies, resulting in
significant discrepancies in a company&#x27;s ESG rating when assessed by different organisations (Lee
and Kim, 2023). Thus, a data-driven approach to ESG estimation is needed, and the studies that focus
on the need for automatic and direct extraction and classification of ESG information are limited. The
Action will investigate the utility of LLM in effectively analyzing and extracting insights from vast
amounts of sustainability-related textual data, such as news articles, to gain deeper insights into
companies’ ESG performance and their societal impact.

Yet,
they
often
fail
to
comprehensively address the coordination between technology, ethics, and regulations. Our Action
aims to meld these disparate threads into a unified framework.
EU Initiatives and Collaborations:
European Blockchain Partnership (EBP), European Fintech Association, the European Green Deal,
the European Digital Finance Package, the European Data Governance Act, AI4EU, and ELISE have
made strides in their respective domains. However, these platforms typically focus on specific facets of
finance or technology. Our Action expands on this by offering an integrative strategy that aligns with
EU priorities, thereby ensuring Europe&#x27;s competitive position on the global stage.
Key Differentiators and added value

Risks for Capacity building objectives
Inadequate Stakeholder Participation (CB1,
CB4): Lack of interest or participation from key
stakeholders, such as legal experts or financial
institutions, undermines the effectiveness of the
joint agendas and stakeholder platforms.
Establish fallback collaborations with academic
institutions
and
NGOs.
Use
incentives
like
whitepapers
or
industry
reports
to
entice
stakeholder participation.
Interdisciplinary
Collaboration
Challenges
(CB2, CB6): Difficulties may arise in achieving
interdisciplinary collaboration, given the diverse
fields of ethics, data science, and finance.
Employ a dedicated interdisciplinary coordinator to
facilitate communication and project management
between
various
disciplines.
Conduct
regular
interdisciplinary workshops.
Limited
Engagement
from
Young
Researchers (CB3): Low participation rates from
young researchers may hinder capacity-building
in the emerging field of federated learning.
Introduce mentorship programs and competitive
grants
targeted
at
young
researchers
to
encourage their active participation.
Lack of Diversity and Inclusion (CB5)
Failure to adequately involve under-represented
genders and marginalized communities could
result in a lack of diversity for XAI methods.
Create targeted outreach programs and provide
scholarships or stipends to facilitate the inclusion
of under-represented groups.
Insufficient
Resources
for
Comprehensive
Capacity-building (CB7): Resource constraints
may hamper the achievement of overall action
deliverables like training materials, publications,
and gender balance reports.
Prioritize deliverables based on their impact and
availability of resources. In the case of budget
limitations,
seek
additional
external
funding

COST Mission and Policies
1. COST Excellence and Inclusiveness:
The two pillars of COST excellence and inclusiveness are:
Strengthening the excellence through the creation of cross-border networking of researchers
Promoting geographical, age and gender balance throughout its activities and operations
Those will be addressed as follows:
In our Action proposal, 59% of the participating countries are Inclusiveness Target Countries. Indeed, we
have all ITCs but two on board. At the start of the Action, we will actively work on adding the remaining two
as well.
All of our COST activities are focused on cross-border collaboration, networking and dissemination of results
across borders.
59% of the participating countries are ITC. We have reserved 50% of the following key leadership positions
in the Action management to a representative of a COST Inclusiveness Target Country. Those are:
Two of the four working group leaders
Two of the four vice-leaders of the working groups
One of the following: Science Communication Coordinator, Scientific Advisory Board Coordinator,
Academia-Industry Coordinator
Vice-Chair of the Action or Grant Awarding Coordinator
The Grant Holder is supposed to be from one of the COST Inclusiveness Target Countries. We have
identified suitable candidates from those countries for the position of Grant Holder Scientific
Representative, who is then expected to assign persons to the positions of Grant Holder Legal
Representative, Grant Holder Financial Representative and Grant Holder Manager, also from ITC.
Geographical, age and gender balance will be addressed as follows: All activities are monitored and
prioritized based on wide geographical inclusion and distribution across Europe:
Our networking tools will reserve at least 50% of the funds for Young Researchers and Innovators.
Gender balance is one of our goals and we will actively promote female participants in all our
activities. Preferences, given the same qualifications, will be given to female researchers. We
currently have 46% female participants and actively aim to increase that to 50% throughout life-time
of the Action.
All ITCs will be members of the Action and funds allocated will be at least 50%. 
2. Participation of non-COST Countries and Specific Organisations:
During the proposal phase, we have focused on including COST countries, where we now have almost all of
the COST countries included in our network. We have five near-neighbouring countries and five international
partners involved, among them the top finance centres globally. One of the first goals of the Action will be to
target additional non-COST countries and include them in our network, within the Rules for Participation of
Non-COST countries and Specific Organisations and the COST Annotated Rules. To include specific
organisations, we will draw on the network of our proposers, who themselves are in contact with a
substantial number of them.  
3. Collaborations between different stakeholders
One of the main objectives of our Action is to enable fruitful collaborations between researchers, engineers,
scholars and other stakeholders and business by providing a natural platform for them to meet and build
mutual trust. In the inaugural MC meeting, we will set up a Stakeholder Committee with the first to write a
stakeholder engagement strategy and plans to implement it. The Core Group will regularly report the
progress of the engagement to the MC and take corrective actions if needed.. 
 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 20"></div><pre class="text-content">
4. Impact of research in the industrial sector
One of our goals is to increase the impact of our research in the industrial sector. We will achieve that by
promoting the use and development of new technologies in the area of Sustainable Digital Finance.
Throughout the research phase, we will actively work together with the Finance industry (this is already
needed given the topic of our Action proposal). Furthermore, our results and outcomes will be actively
disseminated to SMEs as well as established players throughout Europe. This will be done via the COST
networking and dissemination tools, which will always require substantial involvement from the industry. We
envision that all conferences and workshops will have at least a 40% participation rate from industry. 
5. COST Strategic Plan
Our Action has agreed to align all activities with the three COST strategic priorities. Indeed, all targets and
Key Performance Indicators as defined in the COST Strategic Plan, March 2023, are already met during
Proposal phase (as far as they concern that phase), have been agreed upon by the proposers (in so far
COST MC decisions are concerned) or will be our guiding principles.
Specifically: 
5.1 Promoting and spreading excellence
92% of ITCs (23/25) are in our Action during the proposal phase (COST Target: 50%).
A minimum of four leadership positions are filled by ITC participants, as described under 1. (COST
Target: three). 
Our Action has agreed, from day one on, that 50% of the budget will be invested in ITCs/ activities in
ITCs and/or ITC researchers (COST target: 50%).
50% of leadership positions will be occupied by female researchers, as described under 1. (COST
target: 50%).
5.2 Fostering interdisciplinary research for breakthrough science
Our Action has four science disciplines substantially represented and we aim to extend that to six
during the lifetime of the Action (COST Target: 2).
Our current proposers have regularly published more than 30 peer reviewed publications per year in
the topics related to our Action, i.e. 120 over a four-year period (COST Target: 50).
The current proposers submit, on average per year, more than 5 proposals to Horizon Europe on the
topics of this Action, i.e. 20 over a four-year period (COST Target: 2.5).
Our proposers were granted, on average, six H2020 projects over a four-year period, related to the
Action topics (COST Target: 1 per Action).
Considering the output our current proposers produce per year, we will obtain more than 50 success
stories of scientific results and impact per year (COST Target: 50 per year).
5.3. Empowering and retaining young researchers
Our current share of young researchers and innovators is at 35% and we have agreed to make it a
top priority to increase that number to 45% (COST Target: 40%).
Our proposers have agreed to allocate 25% of Action leadership positions to young researchers and
innovators (COST Target: 20%).
As for the overall Action, we will also have a 50% share of female researchers among the young
researchers, already at 48.5% (COST Target: 50%).
