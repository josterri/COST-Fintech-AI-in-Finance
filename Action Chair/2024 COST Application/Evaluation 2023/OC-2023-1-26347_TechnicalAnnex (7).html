TECHNICAL ANNEX
1. S&amp;T EXCELLENCE
1.1 SOUNDNESS OF THE CHALLENGE
1.1.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART
The Action will develop a research framework that will address the key challenges associated with
integrating cutting-edge digital technologies in the finance sector. In achieving this aim, the Action will
drive forward the digitalization of finance while ensuring that core policy objectives, such as consumer
and investor protection, fair competition and stability continue to be met as the digital transformation of
the financial sector continues.
In recent years, we have seen the emergence of new technologies, products and business models at
an unprecedented speed, all summarised under the label Digital Finance. The digitalisation of the
financial industry holds great promise. It offers the opportunity to make quick and cost-effective
payments, enable the development of innovative financial products and services and foster wider
access to financial services thus incorporating previously “unbanked” areas. Put simply, digital
technologies are expected to fundamentally transform the financial service industry. Some
examples of the practitioners’ perspective in terms of the topic’s relevance come from an extensive
analysis done by the World Economic Forum (WEF) (2020), which provides a comprehensive picture
of how digital technologies are applied in financial services by both incumbents and Fintechs. The
study finds that:
●
77% of practitioners anticipate innovative technologies to possess high or very high overall
importance to their businesses in the future
●
Approximately 64% of practitioners anticipate employing innovative digital technologies in all
of the following categories – generating new revenue potential through new products and
processes, process automation, risk management, customer service and client acquisition
●
Overwhelmingly, practitioners expect that digital technologies will become a key success
factor for specific financial service sectors
Despite promises, the fast adoption of innovative technologies in finance poses challenges and risks,
encompassing legal issues like disclosure and oversight, technology-related concerns such as poor
data quality, protection and privacy, lack of sufficient explainability, algorithmic bias, and inconsistency
in ESG assessment. The European Commission has taken steps in addressing some challenges
through GDPR, the AI strategy (European Commission., 2023), and the digital finance package
(European Commission., 2020b). These issues align with UN Sustainable Development Goals
(Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Sustainable Development, 2023) and are increasingly
relevant for financial service companies, as per the 2020 WEF study. To this point, the study done by
WEF (2020) finds that:
●
91% of the surveyed practitioners consider data quality issues to be a key hurdle to deploying
innovative digital technologies like machine learning in practice
●
64% of practitioners consider deficits in trust and user adoption to be another major hindrance
of the adoption of digital technologies in finance
●
Complex models are often developed and evaluated within closed environments which do not
match the conditions of real-world applications
●
Firms are particularly wary of the potential for complex models to entrench biases in
decision-making
Having
in
mind
this
gap
between
the
theoretical
capabilities
of
technology
and its actual
implementation in real-world scenarios, the Action will develop a research framework that addresses
the key technology-related huddles of implementing state-of-art technologies in finance applications
and enable the transition to a digital finance ecosystem that is sustainable, transparent and inclusive.
Specifically, the action will: (i) bolster the EU&#x27;s digital data market by enhancing data quality, protection
and privacy; (ii) establish clear guidelines for integrating generative AI in finance by developing
innovative solutions for risk management, market trend prediction, and personalized financial products
that take into consideration challenges related to data security, ethical considerations and regulatory
compliance; (iii) develop domain-driven XAI solutions for the finance sector by solving some of the key
challenges of deploying explainability to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied
to financial use cases; and (iv) propose data-driven ESG scoring methods.
As a result, the Action’s research framework will lead to more, better, and more inclusive
ﬁnancial innovations that accelerate the digital and green transition of Europe, in line with
Europe’s key strategic priorities such as the development of key digital, enabling and emerging
technologies (DG Research and Innovation, 2021), the European Green Deal, the Digital Finance
Package and the European Approach to AI (European Commission 2023).

</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 2"></div><pre class="text-content">
We elaborate in more detail on the four key technology-related pillars of the future function of finance,
which in turn define the research objectives of the Action:
●
Ensuring data protection, privacy and fairness in financial data (WG1). The distinctive
trait of the emerging new financial ecosystem is the increasing availability of data. Data is in
the centre of the digital transformation and more is to come (EC, A European strategy for data,
2020). Both academia and industry are increasingly faced with data characterised with
staggeringly high number of dimensions, high variability and high veracity. Utilising such data
is accompanied by many challenges among which: How do we ensure that all dimensions
(accuracy, consistency, completeness, currency, volatility and timeliness) of data quality are
satisfied to a necessary extent? What are the key challenges and opportunities in developing
a unified data privacy framework, including clear definitions and methods, for ensuring the
security and compliance of financial applications through the integration of differential privacy
and federated learning techniques? What are the most effective methods and techniques for
assessing and mitigating biases in large financial datasets to achieve data fairness, and how
do these methods impact decision-making processes and outcomes in various finance use
cases?
●
Develop and deploy end-to-end use cases of generative AI&#x27;s applications in finance
(WG2). Generative AI holds transformative potential for the finance sector, offering capabilities
that span from the simulation of intricate financial scenarios and the creation of novel
investment strategies, to the generation of synthetic financial data for enhanced analytics. By
leveraging these models, financial institutions can potentially devise innovative solutions that
enhance risk management and portfolio optimization processes, predict market trends, and
offer personalized financial products tailored to individual consumer preferences. However, the
journey to integrate generative AI into finance is riddled with challenges: How can sensitive
ﬁnancial data be processed by generative AI models without risking unintentional disclosures?
What are the potential applications and limitations of large language models (LLM) in
predicting ﬁnancial market movements, and how can these models be effectively integrated
into existing ﬁnancial forecasting methodologies? How do we assess the suitability and
effectiveness of LLM in the speciﬁc applications of portfolio optimization and risk
management? How can the potential of generative AI be fully harnessed in the ﬁnance sector
while ensuring no compromises on security, ethics, or regulatory compliance?
●
Ensure explainability and fairness of AI-based systems in finance (WG3). In order to
address the “black box” challenge of AI solutions, the concept of eXplainable AI (XAI)
emerged, introducing a suite of techniques attempting to explain to users how complex
models arrived at certain decisions. For the most part, these techniques, introduced primarily
through academic efforts, are not tailored to ﬁnancial use cases and datasets and, as such,
their ability to bring forward robust and stable explanations concerning the inner-working of
complex models applied in ﬁnance, is limited. In this context, pending research questions are:
To what extent existing XAI tools address the explainability needs of different stakeholders
within
the
ﬁnancial
value
chain?
–How
can
we
build
XAI
methods that are not
perturbation-based and thus maintain the natural time ordering and dependence structures of
the data? How can we make sure that algorithmic systems do not yield socially-biassed
outcomes, thereby compounding inequalities? How can we deal with the persisting latency in
computing and showing explanations in real time? How can XAI platforms enhance ethics in
the use of AI predictive models and ensure compliance with GDPR?
●
Streamlining ESG assessment and reporting (WG4). Sustainable finance will have a key
role to play in the future function of finance as climate change and environmental degradation
are becoming an existential threat to Europe and the world (EC, European green deal, 2019).
As clearly stated in the European Green Deal strategy, sustainable finance and investment will
be key to fostering sustainable global development. Though inevitable, transitioning to a
sustainable future with inclusive, green economies and resilient ecosystems is associated with
many challenges. With the Action, we will answer the following research questions: What are
the key components and methodological considerations in developing a real-time, data-driven
ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scoring model that integrates sentiment
analysis obtained through the utilisation of LLM? How can the resulting model be effectively
disseminated, either as an open-source tool or as a policy recommendation, to enhance
sustainability assessments and regulatory oversight in the financial sector? How do different
data-driven ESG measurement techniques, incorporating LLM for sentiment analysis and
news report analysis, compare in terms of accuracy, reliability, and suitability for assessing the
sustainability performance of organizations, and what are the implications for informed
decision-making by investors and stakeholders?

</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 3"></div><pre class="text-content">
In this context, the Action will ensure that the European finance industry will stay globally competitive,
give
European
consumers
access to innovative financial products, while ensuring consumer
protection, financial stability and contribute to ESG and European Green Deal goals.
A research initiative aimed at overcoming the obstacles associated with AI deployment in finance
demands a transdisciplinary, gender-balanced, international research network with a strong
focus on young researchers and innovators for several compelling reasons. First, financial
systems are by design intricately interconnected and globally interdependent, influenced by an array of
factors that transcend national boundaries. Researchers from different regions bring valuable
perspectives to the table, shedding light on regional nuances and providing a comprehensive
understanding of the global financial landscape. Second, addressing these challenges goes beyond
the confines of single disciplines. It involves a blend of expertise from computer science, economics,
law, ethics, regulation, and cybersecurity. A transdisciplinary approach ensures that all aspects of the
problem are thoroughly explored and integrated into potential solutions. Thirdly, financial data is
diverse and subject to regional regulations. Collaboration on an international scale facilitates the
aggregation of heterogeneous datasets, addresses data privacy concerns, and establishes common
data standards crucial for the development and training of AI models. Fourth, financial regulations vary
across countries, and ethical considerations are essential. An international research network can
facilitate the exchange of regulatory insights and ethical best practices, ensuring that AI systems are
compliant with international standards. Lastly, collaboration on an international scale accelerates the
development of AI solutions for finance. By pooling resources, knowledge, and expertise from
researchers and institutions across Europe, collaborative efforts can drive innovation, leading to more
effective and globally applicable solutions.
1.1.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHALLENGE (MAIN AIM)
The Action will establish a cross-border network of professionals across finance, mathematics,
statistics, computer sciences, law and ethics, focusing on solving the main hurdles of integrating AI
systems into the different functions of finance. The main goal is to develop a collaborative platform that
derives
AI-driven,
robust,
explainable
and
sustainable
systems
that
will
support
the
digital
transformation of finance. Currently, there exists a significant gap between the theoretical
possibilities of AI-based systems and the actual feasibility of implementing these capabilities
in real-world scenarios in finance. While numerous researchers have established the effectiveness
of AI-based systems across diverse predictive tasks (Dingli and Fournier, 2017, Di Persio and
Honchar, 2017, Sen and Mehtab, 2021, Cao, 2022), there remains a critical need for research focused
on identifying (and addressing) the key barriers hindering their widespread adoption in real-world
financial use cases, thus leading to sustained and expansive impacts in Finance, ensuring a green
and digital transition. Specifically, through joint international efforts and interdisciplinary expertise, the
Action will address hurdles related with the different stages of building and deploying AI-based
systems. In order to ensure that all dimensions of data quality are satisfied, the COST action will:
develop a comprehensive data quality assessment framework, establish a unified data privacy
framework for financial applications, and identify effective methods for assessing and mitigating biases
in large financial datasets. Looking at the model deployment hurdles that industry is faced with, the
Action will: prototype and deploy end-to-end generative AI use cases in finance, propose guidelines for
sensitive financial data processing by AI models, introduce novel metrics for evaluating the utility of
LLM for financial market prediction, and run an assessment of their suitability for portfolio optimization
and risk management. For the purpose of bringing suitable level of explainability and trust into
deployed AI systems in finance, the Action will: evaluate existing XAI tools, propose novel
finance-specific XAI methods, train and test strategies for preventing socially-biassed outcomes in
AI-based risk management systems, and research into real-time solutions for reducing latency in AI
explanations. Finally, in order to ensure a data-driven assessment of sustainability, the Action will:
create a real-time, data-driven ESG scoring model integrating sentiment analysis, document methods
for effective dissemination (either as an open-source tool or policy recommendations), and conduct a
comparative analysis of data-driven ESG measurement techniques, including the utilization of LLM for
enhanced sustainability assessments and regulatory oversight in finance.
The ultimate goal of the Action is to blend diverse expertise that allows us to optimally use
high-dimensional data and state-of-art AI systems to push forward the digitalization of the functions of
finance. Emerging AI technologies, distinct from conventional methods, present clear benefits for the
financial sector. The effectiveness of these methods will be measured and contextualised in terms of
their practicality and challenges of real-world implementation. While the focus is on financial
applications, the outcomes will be applicable to wider fields, and efforts will be made to share insights
across different industry domains.

1.2 PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE OF THE ART
1.2.1 APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGE AND PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE OF THE ART
From a methodological perspective, the Action will focus on bringing forward several contributions to
the literature. In the context of ensuring data quality, privacy and protection, the Action will test
different state-of-art techniques proposed in the literature for tackling privacy issues in deep and
federated learning (FL). Particularly, we will focus on differential privacy (DP). The primary aim of
differential privacy (DP) is to enable the examination of dataset characteristics related to a population
as a whole, all while safeguarding individual privacy (Dwork, 2006, Dwork 2008, Ouadrhiri et al.,
2022). In simpler terms, DP involves introducing perturbations, either in statistical inquiries or the
original dataset, to prevent an adversary from determining whether a specific individual is part of the
dataset or not. This approach is considered a de facto standard for protecting users’ privacy in
statistical computations. The Action will run and compare several applications of DP for financial data
sets and time series. Moreover, the network will also tackle the challenges evolving in algorithmic bias.
Many financial services, such as mortgage or loan approvals, are algorithmically aided decisions.
Such techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods, are not inherently biassed
but often oblivious to sensitive parameters. This can be a result of bias introduced at any step in the
life cycle (Davidson et al., 2023) including, e.g., socio-historical bias in the data generation process,
Simpson’s Paradox as an example of aggregation bias (Prost et al., 2023) or the choice of
optimization functions, regularizations that can contribute to biassed algorithmic decisions. Within the
COST Action, researchers will explore a wide variety of methods to debias algorithmic solutions for
financial applications. Since many fair learning algorithms have already been implemented (like IBM
(2023) AI Fairness 360 toolkit), the researchers within COST will analyze the possibility of adjusting
and extending those methods for problems arising in the financial sector. Moreover, much of the
attention will be focused on developing new approaches to fight against bias both on the data and
methods side. On the algorithmic side, the researchers will investigate the approach based on
disparate learning processes (DLPs) that allows the sensitive attributes during the learning phase but
not during the prediction time (Lipton et al., 2018) or Variational Fair Autoencoder, which treats
protected attributes as the nuisance variables (Louizos, 2015). On the data debiasing side, a very
interesting approach is Fair Adversarial Networks (FairGAN), whose goal is to create synthetic data of
similar quality as real data, not discriminatory toward certain demographic groups (Wu, 2022).
Considering the application of generative AI in finance, the Action will develop end-to-end use cases
which will detail the entire pipeline of building AI-systems incorporating LLMs for financial applications.
LLM have been shown to be very effective on a variety of language tasks (information and knowledge
queries, analysing text data, generating briefs and reports) (Wu et al., 2023, Xie et al., 2023, Zhao et
al., 2023, Hadi et al., 2023). However, most of the implementations available in the literature do not
take into consideration the practical constraints (like regulatory compliance, scalability, privacy
concerns, etc.) in which the financial sector operates. To this end, the Action will assess the potential
and limitations of LLM for various financial applications (i.e. predicting financial markets, enhancing
risk management and portfolio optimization processes) and propose guidelines for effectively
integrating their outputs into classic methodologies for classification and prediction.
Furthermore, the Action will also aim at proposing solutions for the growing “trust” issues with complex
models. The introduction of complex ML and DL methods for financial use cases (i.e. time series
forecasting or credit scoring), potentially enables higher predictive accuracy but this comes at the cost
of higher complexity and thus lower interpretability (Hulsen, 2023),. ML models are referred to as
“black boxes” because it is often difficult to understand how variables are jointly related to arrive at a
certain output (Arrieta et al., 2019). This reduced ability to understand the inner workings and
mechanisms of complex models unavoidably affects their trustworthiness and the willingness among
practitioners to deploy such methods in sensitive domains such as finance. As a result, the scientific
interest in the field of eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has grown tremendously within the last
few years (Gunning et al., 2019, Linardatos et al., 2021, Dazeley et al., 2021 and Saeed and Omlin,
2023). XAI aims at introducing a suite of techniques attempting to communicate understandable
information about how an already developed model produces its predictions for any given input
(Arrieta et al., 2019). The growing popularity of the topic notwithstanding, research on XAI in finance
remains limited and most of the existing explainability techniques are not suited for financial data
which are characterised with dependence of features and non-stationarity. Many state-of-the-art XAI
methods are originally tailored for certain input types such as images (ex. Saliency Maps) or text (ex.
LRP) and have later been adjusted to suit tabular data as well. However, temporal dimensions and
features&#x27; dependence are often omitted, and the literature currently offers only a limited consideration
of the topic. Notable examples are interpretable decision trees for time series classification (Hidasi and
Gáspár-Papanek, 2011) and using attention mechanisms (Hsu et al., 2019, Schockaert, 2020) with
none of the applications looking specifically at explainability for financial data. To address this gap in
oc-2023-1
4/15


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 5"></div><pre class="text-content">
the literature as well as in the considered application field, the Action will focus on investigating the
utility of existing state-of-art XAI methods and proposing novel methods for financial applications.
Finally, the Action will also focus on tackling several methodological challenges related to the
sustainable
finance
domain.
Numerous
organisations
are assessing businesses&#x27; non-financial
endeavours by employing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics as assessment
criteria (Almeyda and Darmansya, 2019 and Bassen and Kovacs, 2020). Nevertheless, the reliability
of existing ESG ratings is constrained by variations in criteria among assessment bodies, resulting in
significant discrepancies in a company&#x27;s ESG rating when assessed by different organisations (Lee
and Kim, 2023). Thus, a data-driven approach to ESG estimation is needed, and the studies that focus
on the need for automatic and direct extraction and classification of ESG information are limited. The
Action will investigate the utility of LLM in effectively analyzing and extracting insights from vast
amounts of sustainability-related textual data, such as news articles, to gain deeper insights into
companies’ ESG performance and their societal impact.
1.2.2 OBJECTIVES
1.2.2.1 Research Coordination Objectives
The scientific progress will be pursued by capitalising on the COST research coordination tools. The
specific objectives in this respect are shown below.

4.1.3 RISK ANALYSIS AND CONTINGENCY PLANS
Description of the Risk
Contingency Measure
Risks for Research coordination objectives
Inconsistency in Data Privacy Regulations
(RC1, RC6): The changing privacy regulations
can introduce inconsistencies, making it difficult
to create a unified framework for data privacy.
Monitor
ongoing
changes
in
regulations
and
maintain flexibility in the framework to adapt to
new guidelines. Collaborate with legal advisors to
ensure alignment with international standards.
Data Quality and Standardization (RC2): Poor
data
quality
or
lack
of
data
standardization
impacts the effectiveness of AI models.
Develop
robust
data
validation
and cleansing
processes.
Implement
mechanisms
for
data
governance to ensure data quality.
Limited Adoption of XAI Protocols (RC3, RC7)
Non-adherence to standardized protocols for XAI
by stakeholders and research communities may
result in fragmented and non-scalable solutions.
Actively promote the protocols through webinars,
publications,
and
partnerships
with
key
stakeholders. Create incentives for the adoption of
standardized practices
Inaccurate ESG Measurements (RC4, RC8)
The rapidly evolving field of ESG can result in
outdated or inaccurate measurements.
Regularly
review
and
adapt methodologies to
ensure they align with current ESG norms and
standards.
Resource Portal Mismanagement (RC5): The
shared resource portal can become disorganized
or outdated, affecting all Working Groups.
Implement automated quality checks and periodic
manual reviews to maintain the accuracy and
relevance of shared resources.

Risks for Capacity building objectives
Inadequate Stakeholder Participation (CB1,
CB4): Lack of interest or participation from key
stakeholders, such as legal experts or financial
institutions, undermines the effectiveness of the
joint agendas and stakeholder platforms.
Establish fallback collaborations with academic
institutions
and
NGOs.
Use
incentives
like
whitepapers
or
industry
reports
to
entice
stakeholder participation.
Interdisciplinary
Collaboration
Challenges
(CB2, CB6): Difficulties may arise in achieving
interdisciplinary collaboration, given the diverse
fields of ethics, data science, and finance.
Employ a dedicated interdisciplinary coordinator to
facilitate communication and project management
between
various
disciplines.
Conduct
regular
interdisciplinary workshops.
Limited
Engagement
from
Young
Researchers (CB3): Low participation rates from
young researchers may hinder capacity-building
in the emerging field of federated learning.
Introduce mentorship programs and competitive
grants
targeted
at
young
researchers
to
encourage their active participation.
Lack of Diversity and Inclusion (CB5)
Failure to adequately involve under-represented
genders and marginalized communities could
result in a lack of diversity for XAI methods.
Create targeted outreach programs and provide
scholarships or stipends to facilitate the inclusion
of under-represented groups.
Insufficient
Resources
for
Comprehensive
Capacity-building (CB7): Resource constraints
may hamper the achievement of overall action
deliverables like training materials, publications,
and gender balance reports.
Prioritize deliverables based on their impact and
availability of resources. In the case of budget
limitations,
seek
additional
external
funding
through grants or partnerships.
