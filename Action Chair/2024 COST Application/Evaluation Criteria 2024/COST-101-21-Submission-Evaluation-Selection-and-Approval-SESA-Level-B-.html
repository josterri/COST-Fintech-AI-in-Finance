COST 101/21 
 
COST ACTION PROPOSAL SUBMISSION, EVALUATION, 
SELECTION AND APPROVAL 
(LEVEL B) 
 
The COST Committee of Senior Officials (“CSO”) having regard to: 
The Statutes of the COST Association, 
 
The Internal Rules of the COST Association, 
 
The CSO Decision COST 088/21, “Rules and Principles for COST Activities”, 
In accordance with its role as General Assembly of the COST Association,  
 
Whereas 
 
(1) COST Full Members have established an International not-for-profit Association, the COST 
Association, integrating the governance, management and implementation functions of COST. 
(2) COST contributes to the objective of strengthening the scientific and technological bases of the 
European Research Area by promoting the European-based scientific and technological 
networking encouraging all stakeholders to share, create and apply knowledge, thereby 
encouraging Europe to become more competitive.

peaceful purposes; any funding of activities related to sensitive technology development, 
armament or defence-oriented research should be avoided. COST should support activities 
carried out in compliance with fundamental ethical principles. 
 
(10) COST should establish rules and procedures to govern the submission, evaluation, selection 
and approval of proposals for COST Actions and other activities where appropriate. 
(11) COST should protect EU financial interests and ensure sound financial management. COST is 
aware that the EU auditing procedures apply. 
The CSO has adopted the present rules for Submission, Evaluation, Selection and Approval for COST 
Action Proposals in accordance with the Rules and Principles for COST Activities.  
The present rules shall be subordinated to and may not contravene the Rules and Principles for COST 
Activities. In case of any contradiction between those CSO Decisions, the Rules and Principles for COST 
Activities shall prevail.  
These rules shall enter into force on 18 November 2021, approval date of the Committee of Senior 
Officials. 
 
SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE  
COST shall strive to implement transparent, cost-efficient, timely and simple evaluation and selection 
procedures.  
 
This decision shall lay down the rules and procedure for the submission, evaluation, selection and 
approval of COST Action proposals. These rules derive from the basic principles laid down in the Rules 
and Principles for COST Activities. 
These rules shall be further detailed and explained in the Level C document: COST Open Call 
Applicants’ Guidelines - Submission, Evaluation, Selection and Approval (SESA).

1. BASIC PRINCIPLES 
The present rules shall reflect the basic principles governing the submission, evaluation, selection and 
approval of proposals for COST Actions which shall ensure fairness, transparency, openness, 
excellence and inclusiveness. 
 
COST shall make the best endeavours to avoid conflict of interest. 
 
All those involved in the submission, evaluation, selection and approval of proposals shall commit to 
confidentiality. 
 
2. OBLIGATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY  
Each person involved in the submission, evaluation, selection and approval procedure (Independent 
External Expert, Review Panel Member, Scientific Committee Member, CNC and CSO Member) shall: 
 
• Treat confidentially any information, including personal data of any natural person concerned by 
or involved in the submission, evaluation, selection and approval of proposals process, and 
documents, in any form (i.e. paper or electronic), disclosed in writing or orally in relation to the 
performance of the evaluation;  
 
• Process any confidential information or documents as described above only for the purposes and 
for the duration of the submission, evaluation, selection and approval of proposals process;  
 
• Not disclose, directly or indirectly, confidential information or documents relating to proposals or 
applicants, without prior written approval of the COST Association; 
 
• Not discuss any proposal with others, including other evaluators or staff not directly involved in 
evaluating the proposal, except during formal discussions at dedicated Review Panels and 
Scientific Committee meetings;  
 
• Not disclose any detail of the evaluation process and its outcomes or of any proposal submitted 
for evaluation for any purpose other than fulfilling their tasks as evaluator; 
 
• Not disclose the names of other experts participating in the evaluation; 
 
• Not communicate with proposers on any proposal during or after the evaluation until the approval 
by the CSO. 
 
Further, under no circumstances should the proposers contact any of the actors involved in the 
evaluation, selection and approval procedure regarding their proposal. Any attempt to do so may lead 
to immediate exclusion of the proposal from the evaluation, selection and approval process. 
3. COST OPEN CALL 
The COST Open Call shall allow submitting proposals on a continuous basis. 
 
COST shall publish on its website the official announcement of the Open Call indicating the Collection 
Date, the description of the procedure and complete schedule, and criteria against which COST Action 
proposals shall be evaluated and selected. 
 
The COST Open Call shall enhance transparency of COST through an accessible bottom-up opportunity 
with rigorous peer review. Proposals shall be evaluated on a competitive basis, taking into account the 
available funds for the particular Collection Date. 
 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 5"></div><pre class="text-content">

The proposal shall be submitted by a Main Proposer acting on behalf of a network of proposers who 
see an opportunity for advancing scientific, technological or social knowledge and impact resulting from 
such advancements through the international coordination support offered by COST. 
 
The Open Call is a one-stage submission process where proposals may be registered and submitted at 
any time before the Collection Date using a dedicated secure online tool. Proposals shall be gathered 
at the Collection Date. 
The Open Call follows the subsequent phases:  
• Proposal Submission by a Main Proposer on behalf of a network of proposers; 
• Proposal Assessment for Eligibility; 
• Proposal Evaluation by Independent External Experts and ad-hoc Review Panels; 
• Proposal Selection by the Scientific Committee; 
• Proposal Approval by the CSO. 
 
4. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION 
Proposals shall be submitted by a network of proposers, represented by a Main Proposer. The network 
shall be composed of proposers from at least seven (7) COST Full or Cooperating Members amongst 
which a minimum number (≥50%) shall be from COST Inclusiveness Target Countries1 (see also in 
Annex B to the present decision the required minimum number of COST Inclusiveness Target Countries 
per number of COST Full or Cooperating Members represented in a proposal).  
 
The table below shows who can be part of a Network of Proposers as Main Proposer or Secondary 
Proposer.

the EU Member State they are linked to2.  
 
Proposals may be registered and submitted at any time before the Collection Date via a secured online 
tool designed for this purpose (e-COST). The online tool allows the Main Proposer to access, edit and 
submit the proposal until the chosen Collection Date. Only the last submitted version of a proposal shall 
be considered for evaluation. 
 
Proposals shall be written in English, as no translation shall be provided, and peer reviewers come from 
different countries.

5. PROPOSAL 
ASSESSMENT 
AGAINST 
ELIGIBILITY 
CRITERIA 
To be eligible, a proposal for a COST Action shall: 
 
a) Represent a network of proposers from at least seven (7) COST Full or Cooperating Members 
amongst which ≥50% shall be from COST Inclusiveness Target Countries as detailed in 
Annex B with proposers having a registered e-COST profile; 
b) Respect fundamental ethical principles as described in the Rules and Principles for COST 
Activities3 with particular emphasis on the originality of findings and ideas, and on peaceful 
purposes of the addressed science and technology challenges; 
c) Respect word or page limits as described in the COST Open Call Applicants’ Guidelines - 
Submission, Evaluation Selection and Approval (SESA)4; 
d) Be written in English, the working language of the COST Association 
e) Be anonymous, hence contain no reference to the proposers’ and/or institutions’ names 
participating in the network of proposers, meaning that proposers and/or institutions’ names 
should neither be explicitly mentioned nor be potentially identifiable5. 
 
Proposals can be declared ineligible at any point of the process should any breach of the above eligibility 
criteria be identified during the evaluation. 
6. PROPOSAL EVALUATION  
6.1 EXPERTS ROLE  
Three different groups of experts shall intervene throughout the procedure towards selection of the best 
proposals: the Independent External Experts, the ad-hoc Review Panels and the Scientific Committee. 
6.1.1.  EXTERNAL EXPERTS 
Independent External Experts carry out the remote peer-review evaluation.  
 
They shall be identified, selected and assigned to proposals on the basis of their scientific and 
technological expertise necessary for the evaluation of proposals. This will notably be based on 
Research Areas6 and keywords chosen by the network of proposers themselves.  
 
Whenever possible, each External Expert will evaluate at least three proposals.  
6.1.2.  REVIEW PANELS 
Ad-hoc Review Panels shall be established after each Collection Date based on the number and topics 
of received proposals from a pool of active researchers and innovators, previously nominated by the 
COST National Coordinators.  
 
The experts shall register in the COST Expert Database (e-COST). A Review Panel expert may serve 
in the Review Panels for a maximum of four collections out of eight successive collections. After four 
participations as Review Panel expert, a minimum of four collections shall pass before the same person 
may participate again as Review Panel expert. In all cases, COST shall strive for diversity among RP 
members in topic expertise and experience in serving in the RP.   
 
The Review Panels shall ensure the quality of the Independent External Expert evaluation outcome and 
resolve potential differences in their opinions.

As the outcome of their work, the Review Panels prepare a shortlist of proposals with their validated 
consensus reports and marks for examination and selection by the Scientific Committee.  
 
In addition, the Review Panels shall prepare a report to the Scientific Committee using the templates 
provided by COST. 
6.1.3. 
COST SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
The Scientific Committee shall guarantee that the present rules and procedures shall all be observed 
throughout the process. Specifically, the Scientific Committee shall: 
 
a) Assess and accordingly make a recommendation to the COST Administration with regard to the 
eligibility of proposals that have been identified as potentially breaching the Rules and Principles 
for COST Activities;  
b) Identify, among the list of proposals presented by the Review Panels, those that respond best 
to COST Mission and Policy; 
c) Establish the shortlist of proposals that shall be presented to the CSO for approval. 
6.2   PROPOSAL EVALUATION 
Proposals shall be evaluated against the following two-step procedure. During this process, the identity 
of the Main Proposer and of the network of proposers will be kept anonymous. 
6.2.1 STEP 1 – EXTERNAL REMOTE EVALUATION 
Each proposal shall be evaluated by a minimum of 3 Independent External Experts identified, selected 
and assigned to proposals as described here above. The evaluation shall be performed remotely, and 
each Independent External Expert shall submit an evaluation report for each proposal he/she evaluates.  
 
Further to the individual evaluation, a consensus shall be sought between the Independent External 
Experts (remotely). 
 
The consensus shall not be imposed; Independent External Experts may maintain their views on the 
proposal. 
6.2.2 STEP 2 – REVISION BY AD-HOC REVIEW PANELS 
In addition to the evaluation performed by the Independent External Experts, the ad-hoc Review Panels 
shall ensure the quality of the consensus evaluation report, deliberate how to manage differences in 
opinions, arbitrate and establish a ranked list of proposals having passed the overall threshold as 
described hereunder.  
Review Panels shall: 
 
a) Review and validate the evaluation consensus reports and marks of the proposals for which the 
Independent External Experts achieved consensus. 
b) For proposals without consensus, resolve the differences in opinions between the External 
Experts, using one of the following options:  
• 
Choose any mark within the range of marks awarded by the individual Independent 
External Experts or the non-agreed consensus mark entered into e-COST as the review 
consensus mark and produce the consensus report. 
• 
In exceptional cases, ask for one or two additional Independent External Experts to 
remotely evaluate the proposal. In this case the Review Panel shall make use of the 
additional evaluation reports to prepare the final consensus report and mark. 
c) Strive for consistency of marking across the proposals within and across the Review Panel(s). 
d) Identify those proposals with potential high impact or that indicate emerging issues or potentially 
important future developments.  
 
At their meeting, the Review Panels shall prepare their reports for the Scientific Committee.

Those evaluation criteria shall be further explained in the SESA Guidelines. 
 
Proposals failing to achieve the overall threshold shall not be funded. 
7.  PROPOSAL SELECTION  
Ahead of the meeting, the Scientific Committee shall receive the reports of the Review Panels as well 
as information on the composition of the network of proposers and other information considered relevant 
on the proposals, such as: 
• Aggregated information on the network of proposers (breakdown, expertise, geographic, age and 
gender distribution); 
• Plans to involve relevant participants or targeted stakeholders; openness to additional 
participants. 
 
Based on this information, the Scientific Committee shall establish the shortlist of proposals for approval 
by the CSO.   
 
In order to do so, the Scientific Committee shall: 
1. Adopt the list of proposals which are of sufficiently high quality to be retained for possible funding 
based on the available budget for the call (the retained proposals); 
2. Select among the retained proposals the ones for the final list on the basis of the following 
criteria applied sequentially: 
a. S&amp;T Excellence, Networking Excellence, Impact and Implementation as described in 
6.3. 
b. Compliance with COST Excellence and Inclusiveness policy with regard to 
Inclusiveness issue. A high degree of compliance with it shall be achieved by proposals 
that build the capacity of COST Inclusiveness Target Countries to engage in the 
European Research Area by: 
i. Having very well-defined plans for including COST Inclusiveness Target 
Countries participants in the implementation of the Action; and/or 
ii. Being led by a Main Proposer from an ITC.  
c. Applied with equal weight: 
i. Compliance with COST Excellence and Inclusiveness policy with regard to 
Young Researchers and Innovators (YRI). A high degree of compliance with it 
shall be achieved by proposals: 
1. Presenting a high proportion of Young Researchers and Innovators in 
the Network of Proposers; and/or 
2. Having very well-defined plans for including Young Researchers and 
Innovators in the implementation of the Action; and/or 
3. Led by a Main Proposer being a Young Researcher and Innovator. 
ii. Compliance with COST Excellence and Inclusiveness policy with regard to 
Gender balance. A high degree of compliance with it shall be achieved by 
proposals: 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 9"></div><pre class="text-content">

1. Presenting a good gender balance; and/ or  
2. Having very well-defined plans for achieving gender balance in the 
implementation of the Action; and/or 
3. Led by a Main Proposer of the underrepresented gender. 
d. For proposals that shall be deemed equivalent after application of criteria under 2. a to 
c, achieving a balanced COST Actions’ portfolio and promoting interdisciplinarity. This 
shall be done by selecting proposals addressing Research Areas and/ or Science Sub-
Fields that are less extensively covered among the existing COST Actions’ portfolio and 
those that are of a more interdisciplinary nature. 
 
Detailed procedure shall be described in the COST Open Call Applicants’ Guidelines - Submission, 
Evaluation, Selection and Approval (SESA)7. The Scientific Committee (SC) shall submit the final ranked 
list of selected proposals to the CSO for approval. 
 
The SC shall adopt a SC recommendation per selected proposal and a SC comment per non-selected 
proposal among the retained proposals. 
8.  PROPOSAL APPROVAL 
The final decision on approval and funding for new COST Actions shall be taken by the Committee of 
Senior Officials (CSO) on the basis of the shortlist submitted by the Scientific Committee, together with 
a list of the evaluation results of all evaluated proposals taking into account the available budget. The 
CSO may decide not to approve Actions selected through the procedure described under paragraphs 5 
to 7 of the present rules. 
 
The Technical Annex of a successful proposal approved by the CSO shall form the basis of the Action’s 
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The start of the COST Action shall be described in the 
Annotated Rules for COST Actions. 
 
CNCs will receive the results either before or at the same time as the Main Proposers. The result of the 
evaluation and selection shall be made available to the Main Proposer and the network of proposers via 
e-COST. 
 
9. REDRESS OF THE EVALUATION 
In order to contribute to the fairness and transparency of the COST evaluation process, the COST 
Association has established a redress procedure. The Main Proposer shall thereby have the possibility 
to submit a request for assessment of the evaluation and potential redress.  
 
Redress shall be allowed only in case of potential procedural shortcomings and factual errors, i.e., 
whenever: 
 
• the network of proposers considers that the evaluation has not been carried out in accordance 
with the procedures set out in the current document; 
 
• the network of proposers deems that the evaluation report bears a factual mistake. 
 
Requests for redress dealing with the assessments by the Independent External Experts, of the Review 
Panels or of the Scientific Committee shall not be admissible. 
 
Further, proposal selection by the Scientific Committee as described under section 7 shall not be open 
to redress.

The redress procedure shall be designed to ensure a prompt and fair feedback to requests and shall be 
available in the COST Open Call Applicants’ Guidelines - Submission, Evaluation, Selection and 
Approval (SESA)8. 
 
10.  HONORARIA 
Honoraria shall be paid to the Independent External Experts and ad-hoc Review Panels’ members 
involved in the SESA procedure. The EB shall determine the amount in the relevant COST Open Call 
Applicants’ Guidelines - Submission, Evaluation, Selection and Approval (SESA). 
 
11.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
COST expects ethical behaviour from all participants in COST activities in accordance with the principles 
established in the Rules and Principles for COST Activities. 
 
COST shall strive to avoid any conflict of interest in its evaluation, selection and approval procedure.  
 
Actors involved in the evaluation, selection and approval of proposals may not take any benefit from any 
Action approved under the particular Collection Date they participated in.  
 
The present rules shall apply to all players concerned by the submission, evaluation, selection and 
approval of COST Action proposals (CNC, Independent External Expert, Review Panel Member, 
Scientific Committee Member, and CSO Member). 
 
11.1 CONFLICT OF INTEREST DEFINITION AND CASES 
A Conflict of Interest with regard to the submission, evaluation, selection, and approval procedure shall 
be the risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a person’s duties and responsibilities shall 
be unduly influenced by that person’s professional or private interests. Each individual shall have only 
one role in the evaluation, selection and approval of a COST Action. 
 
A Conflict of Interest can be real, potential or perceived. 
 
1. Cases of Real Conflict of Interest 
 
The person involved in the evaluation or selection procedures (Independent External Expert, Review 
Panel Member, Scientific Committee Member): 
1. 
has been involved in the preparation of the proposal;  
2. 
has been involved in any previous evaluation step in the same Collection.  
 
2. Cases of Potential Conflict of Interest 
 
The person involved in the evaluation or selection procedures (Independent External Expert, Review 
Panel Member, Scientific Committee Member): 
1. 
was aware of the preparation of the proposal;  
2. 
has a professional or personal relationship with a proposer; 
3. 
stands to benefit directly or indirectly if the proposal shall be accepted or rejected. 
 
3. Cases of Perceived Conflict of Interest 
 
The person involved in the evaluation or selection procedures (Independent External Expert, Review 
Panel Member, Scientific Committee Member): 
 
1. 
feels for any reason unable to provide an impartial review of the proposal.
