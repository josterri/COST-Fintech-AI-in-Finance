INTRODUCTION 
This document provides a practical step-by-step guide to the European Cooperation in Science and 
Technology (COST) Open Call rules and procedures for Submission, Evaluation, Selection and 
Approval (SESA) of COST Action proposals, as decided by the COST Committee of Senior Officials 
(CSO).  
Proposers are invited to read the set of COST Implementation Rules establishing the conditions for 
participation in COST activities and in particular in COST Actions, namely: 
 
• 
Annotated Rules for COST Actions (COST 094/21) 
• 
COST Action Proposal Submission, Evaluation, Selection and Approval (COST 101/21)  
They are available at: https://www.cost.eu/funding/documents-guidelines/. These documents are legally 
binding and take precedence over any guideline. In case of any contradiction between the COST 
Implementation Rules and the current guidelines, the COST Implementation Rules shall prevail.  
 
1. OVERVIEW OF COST FRAMEWORK, COST ACTION 
AND OPEN CALL PROCESS 
 
The COST Association is the legal entity in charge of the management and implementation of COST 
strategy, policy and activities towards the achievement of the COST Mission. The overview of the COST 
structure and its intergovernmental dimension can be found at https://www.cost.eu/who-we-are/about-
cost/. 
1.1. The COST framework: mission and policy  
COST is a pan-European intergovernmental framework1 dedicated to European-based Science and 
Technology (S&amp;T) networking activities aiming at allowing their participants to jointly develop their ideas 
and new initiatives across all scientific disciplines through trans-European coordination of nationally or 
otherwise funded research activities. COST has been contributing since its creation in 1971 to closing 
the gap between science, policy makers and society throughout Europe and beyond. 
The COST Mission is to provide networking opportunities for researchers and innovators in order to 
strengthen Europe’s capacity to address scientific, technological and societal challenges. There are 
three strategic priorities: 
• 
promoting and spreading excellence; 
• 
fostering interdisciplinary research for breakthrough science; 
• 
empowering and retaining young researchers. 
COST implements its mission by funding bottom-up, excellence-driven, open and inclusive networks for 
peaceful purposes in all areas of science and technology.  
To achieve its mission, COST provides support for activities such as: 
• 
the development of European-based scientific and technological networks in any scientific or 
interdisciplinary domain; 
• 
the exploitation of the research outcomes by integrating all stakeholders, thereby intensifying 
the links between scientific communities, enterprises, policy makers and society; 
• 
the dissemination of results of such research activities in order to improve their scientific, social 
and economic impact;

• 
the provision for collaboration opportunities to all researchers to employ all talented and creative 
human resources available in Europe overcoming the bottlenecks linked to geographic location, 
age or gender; 
• 
the facilitation of the international collaboration of the European research networks, thereby 
increasing their efficiency, effectiveness and impact within the European Research Area (ERA) 
and at global level; 
• 
COST has put in place the COST Excellence and Inclusiveness policy and a set of rules aiming 
at fulfilling its mission and specific objectives. 
The policy on COST Excellence and Inclusiveness is built upon two pillars: 
• 
strengthening the excellence through the creation of cross-border networking of researchers; 
• 
promoting geographical, age2 and gender balance throughout its activities and operations. 
This policy aims to provide collaboration opportunities to all researchers and innovators in COST Full or 
Cooperating Members3 and to overcome the bottlenecks that prevent the use of all talented and creative 
human resources available for European science. It has the following objectives: 
• 
encouraging and enabling researchers from less research-intensive countries across Europe to 
set up or join COST Actions. These countries are denominated Inclusiveness Target Countries 
(ITC) (see Annex I – Level A: Country and Organisations table); 
• 
counterbalancing research communities’ unequal access to knowledge, infrastructures, funding 
and resources; 
• 
providing strong means to increase the visibility and integration of researchers to the leading 
knowledge hubs of Europe, as well as to acquire their necessary leadership skills, regardless 
of their location, age or gender; 
• 
smoothly contributing to trigger structural changes in the national research systems of COST 
Members; 
• 
identifying excellence across Europe to contribute to ERA widening objectives. 
Through COST global networking, COST encourages the participation of researchers and innovators 
affiliated in non-COST Members4 and Specific Organisations in COST activities on the basis of mutual 
benefit. The participation of researchers from Near Neighbour Countries (NNCs) is particularly 
encouraged, according to the provisions related to eligibility for both participation and reimbursement 
set in the Annotated Rules for COST Actions. 
Further, COST aims at enabling fruitful collaborations between researchers, innovators and other 
stakeholders and business by providing a platform for them to meet and build mutual trust. It also aims 
at increasing impact of research in the industrial sector. With this purpose, COST promotes the use and 
development of technologies, as well as the exploitation5 of COST Action results and outcomes through 
dedicated dissemination and exploitation activities targeting small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs) and large companies in Europe. 
1.2. 
COST Actions 
COST funds networking activities to the benefit of nationally or otherwise funded research activities.  
COST Actions are Science and Technology (S&amp;T) networks open to researchers and innovators 
affiliated to universities, research centres, companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs), as well as other stakeholders and relevant legal entities. All the relevant information to manage 
 
2 COST has a special focus on Young Researchers and Innovators (YRI), defined as ‘researchers or innovators under the age of 
40’ (COST Glossary - https://www.cost.eu/Glossary) 
3 See the list of countries in COST 088/21 Rules and Principles for COST Activities, Annex I 
4 States that are not COST Members. They can be Near Neighbour Countries or Third States (also called International Partner 
Countries)  
5 See COST 094/21 Annotated Rules for COST Actions, Chapter 5.5.2 on Intellectual Property Rights on Action results 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 7"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 7 
a COST Action is presented in the Annotated Rules for COST Actions. COST Actions are set up to 
achieve specific objectives within their four-year duration based upon the sharing, creation, 
dissemination and application of knowledge. These objectives can be reached through COST 
networking activities: 
• 
Meetings (e.g., Management Committee meetings, Working Group meetings); 
• 
Training Schools; 
• 
Mobility of Researchers and Innovators (Short-Term Scientific Missions – STSMs; Virtual 
Mobility - VM); 
• 
Presentations at conferences organised by third parties (ITC Conference presentation and 
Dissemination presentations). 
Further, COST Actions can receive funding for other expenses supporting the Action: 
• 
Dissemination and Communication Products; 
Expenses incurred for the benefit of the network (OERSA and Virtual Networking Support VNS). 
No budget forecast is requested when submitting a proposal. For information, in recent years, the 
average funding received during the 4-year duration of a COST Action amounts to 600,000 EUR. The 
amounts are variable from a grant period to another and depends, among others, on the size of the 
network and overall budget available to COST. COST Actions are: 
• 
Pan-European: the COST inter-governmental framework spans over 41 Full Members, one 
Cooperating Member, and one Partner Member; 
• 
Bottom-up: in terms of S&amp;T fields and topics, COST welcomes any novel, original and 
innovative idea; 
• 
Open: in terms of participation, COST Actions can grow in size; 
• 
Unique: as a platform to coordinate national research funding and resources within a well-
defined framework; 
• 
Multi-, Inter- and Transdisciplinary: bridging different research communities, disciplines, 
fields and methodologies; 
• 
Output and Impact-Oriented: COST Actions are monitored against their expected output and 
impact. 
COST Actions are bottom-up in two ways: their topics are chosen by proposers and the scientific 
management decisions are entrusted to the Action Management Committees. They are open 
throughout their lifetime to new members and are adaptable in terms of internal organisation and 
strategy. They shall promote actively the participation of the next generation of researchers and 
innovators. Thus, COST Actions are especially well-suited to pursue new ideas through collaborative 
efforts and/or to build communities around emerging S&amp;T topics and societal questions. 
1.2.1. COST ACTION STRUCTURE 
The intergovernmental dimension of COST is reflected in the structure of a COST Action. 
The Action Management Committee (MC) is the decision-making body. The Action MC is responsible 
for the coordination, implementation and management of the Action activities and for supervising the 
appropriate allocation and use of the grant with a view to achieve the Action’s scientific and technological 
objectives. It is composed of: 
MC Members: up to two representatives of the COST Full or Cooperating Member. Nomination of MC 
Members is a national prerogative, follows national procedures, and is performed by the COST National 
Coordinator’s (CNCs)6. 
 
6 Before the start of the Action (date of the first Management Committee meeting), persons nominated by the CNC will automatically 
become Action MC Members. After the Action’s first MC meeting, new Action MC Members need to be validated by the Action MC. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 8"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 8 
MC Observers:  
• 
up to two representatives of the COST Partner Member. Action MC Observers from the Partner 
Member are nominated by the respective COST National Coordinator (CNC);  
• 
up to one representative of the Specific Organisation that joined the Action. Action MC 
Observers from Specific Organisations are nominated by the Specific Organisation.  
The MC takes decisions by simple majority vote. MC Observers have no voting rights. 
Working Groups (WGs) are in charge of developing the scientific activities needed to achieve the 
Action objectives, in line with the Action strategy defined by the Action MC. The composition is based 
on WG applications submitted via the Action page on the COST website, the leadership is subject to 
the Action MC vote, and the activity of the WG is defined by the MC and the MoU. 
COST Actions are funded via yearly Action Grant Agreements (AGAs) based on annual Work and 
Budget Plans (W&amp;BPs), detailing the activities designed to achieve the objectives defined in the MoU. 
The Action’s activities are decided by the Action MC, taking advantage of the full range of the COST 
networking activities. The rules applying to their funding are defined in the Annotated Rules for COST 
Actions. 
The research and development activities needed for the achievement of the Action objectives are not 
funded by COST and rely on nationally or otherwise funded research projects and resources (e.g., 
employees’ time, infrastructures and equipment). COST Actions aim at leveraging national or other 
sources of funding towards efficient trans-European research cooperation. 
1.2.2. PARTICIPANTS 
COST Actions are open to all researchers and innovators who are committed to work on and achieve 
the Action objectives and are affiliated to a legal entity7. Action Participants are defined as any person 
being an Action MC Member, an Action MC Observer, a Working Group member or an ad hoc 
participant: 
Action MC Members and Observers: their role is to represent and benefit their national community 
and pro-actively participate in the implementation of coordination and management decisions in the 
Action.  
WG members: any individual affiliated to a legal entity in any country in the world may become a WG 
member. Their participation needs to be approved by the Action MC, based on an application submitted 
through the Action page on the COST website. Their role is to contribute to the achievement of the 
Action objectives through their participation in WG(s). 
Ad hoc Participants: Individuals selected, as necessary, by the Action MC to contribute to the COST 
Action activities towards the achievement of the COST Action Objectives. Ad hoc participants can be 
STSM grantees, trainees and trainers in Training Schools, and invited speakers at COST Action 
Workshops and Conferences. 
All Action Participants must be affiliated to a legal entity located in a COST Member or in any NNC or 
Third State (IPC8).  
A legal entity can be (non-exhaustive list) a public entity (national, regional, local public authority or any 
other kind of public entity), a university, a research centre, company, association, Specific Organisation 
or any other form of legal entity recognised under a national or international framework9. 
 
7 For more detailed information, please check COST 094/21 Annotated Rules for COST Actions.

The eligibility for reimbursement and the rules for participation depend on the status of country or specific 
organisation the participant is affiliated to according to COST rules (see Annotated Rules for COST 
Actions and Annex I – Level A : Country and Organisations table). 
The procedures to participate in a COST Action may be found in the Annotated Rules for COST Actions. 
1.3. COST Open Call and SESA processes 
The COST Open Call is implemented via the Submission, Evaluation, Selection and Approval (SESA) 
procedure. COST publishes the official announcement of the Open Call on Funding Documents &amp; 
Guidelines with the Collection Date, the schedule, the description of the procedure and reference to the 
evaluation criteria. Further information including an Open Call infographic is available on the Open Call 
page on the COST website. 
The proposal submission involves a one-stage submission process. Proposals may be submitted 
through a dedicated secured online tool, e-COST (further details are provided in Chapter 2). 
The proposal evaluation and selection follow a three-step process further described in Chapter 3 of 
these guidelines: 
Step 1 – Evaluation by Independent External Experts 
Step 2 – Revision and Quality Check of Consensus Evaluation Reports by ad hoc Review Panels 
Step 3 – Proposals’ Selection by COST Scientific Committee (SC) 
The shortlist of proposals selected by the SC is submitted to the CSO for approval. Further details about 
the three-step process and the approval are provided in Chapter 3. 
Proposals are evaluated and selected on a competitive basis, taking into account the available funds 
for the particular Open Call Collection. 
COST reserves the right to involve observers to assess and provide feedback on the Evaluation and 
Selection process. 
 
2. PREPARING AND SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL FOR A 
COST ACTION 
2.1. Registration for submission 
Proposals shall be submitted by a network of proposers, represented by only one Main Proposer 
affiliated to an institution located in a COST Full or Cooperating Member, or affiliated to a European 
RTD organisation or EU body, office or agency, as described in Table 1.

Independent workers are ineligible as Main or Secondary Proposer. 
To submit a proposal to the COST Open Call, the Main Proposer has first to create an e-COST profile, 
an account (if not registered yet) in e-COST (https://e-services.cost.eu/). The Main Proposer will be able 
to create, manage and submit their proposal before the Collection Date, by logging into e-COST and 
selecting the e-COST Submission Tool, by clicking “Open Call”, “Proposals”, “Create New proposal” 
(https://e-services.cost.eu/sesa/quickAccess). 
The proposal has a draft status until it is submitted. Once it is submitted, it may still be revised as many 
times as needed before the Collection Date. N.B.: when being revised, the proposal loses its 
“submitted” status. To be evaluated, it needs to be submitted again before the Collection Date. 
Proposals that are not submitted will not be evaluated. The draft proposal is saved in the system and 
may be accessed and retrieved by the Main Proposer until the Collection Date. Please note that after 
the Collection Date the proposal data are only available in read mode and none of its sections is 
transferable to another Open Call collection. 
In order to avoid possible congestions of the e-COST Submission Tool, it is highly recommended to 
avoid submitting the proposal just before the Collection Date. 
A submitted proposal may not be identical, not even in part, to another one submitted during the same 
collection. Should this occur, only the proposal which is submitted first shall be considered.  
In case of re-submission of a proposal, the latest template of the Technical Annex must be used (see 
Chapter 2.2). 
All enquiries concerning the Open Call can be addressed directly from the “contact us” link in e-COST 
or by sending an e-mail to opencall@cost.eu.

2.2. Eligibility criteria 
Please pay particular attention to this Chapter and to each one of the following eligibility 
criteria10.  
COST Action proposals must: 
• 
represent a Network of Proposers from at least 7 different COST Full or Cooperating Members 
among which at least 50% shall be from COST Inclusiveness Target Countries as detailed 
in the Annex of this document; 
• 
respect fundamental ethical principles as described in the Annotated Rules for COST Actions 
(COST 094/21) and in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity11, with particular 
emphasis on originality of findings and ideas, and on peaceful purposes of the addressed S&amp;T 
challenges; 
• 
respect word and page limits as described in Chapter 2.4.2 of this document. Do not change 
in any way the compulsory format of the “Technical Annex” (font, margins, line spacing, etc.) 
and make sure any added figures or tables are readable. Furthermore, do not provide links or 
references to any additional information about the proposal (web link to pages describing the 
proposal, audio-visual material, etc); 
• 
be written in English, the working language of the COST Association; 
• 
be anonymous, in order to comply with the double-blind principle of the evaluation: 
proposals may not contain any direct or indirect reference to people and/or their 
institutions participating in the Network of Proposers (Main or Secondary Proposers). 
This means that names of proposers or their institutions should neither be explicitly 
mentioned, nor be potentially identifiable through, e.g., links to web pages or through 
references to their role and/or participation in existing or ended projects, grants, 
networks. 
Table 2: Examples of statements resulting in ineligibility and statements that are eligible. 
Statements resulting in ineligibility

Note on “References”: 
o 
In the “References” section of the proposal, you may quote proposers’ own publications, 
provided that:  
▪ 
a) there is no emphasis (in the text e.g., in bold/italics or with links) that the 
publication is authored by one or more of the proposers and  
▪ 
b) it is only one or a few of the references in the reference list provided. 
 
Proposals may be declared ineligible at any stage of the SESA process, whenever a breach of the 
above eligibility criteria is identified. Main Proposers will be informed by the COST Association of the 
ineligibility of their proposal. 
2.3. Network of Proposers: requirements 
The Network of Proposers must fulfil the following requirements: 
• 
The Network of Proposers must include at least 7 different COST Full or Cooperating Members 
i.e., countries (one country where the Main Proposer has its entity of affiliation located, plus at 
least 6 other countries for the Secondary Proposers) amongst which at least 50% shall be from 
COST Inclusiveness Target Countries as detailed in Annex I – Level A : Country and 
Organisations Table and in the Annex of this document. There can be more than one proposer 
from the same institution, as long as it is clearly beneficial for the proposed Action. Similarly, 
there is no limit on the maximum number of proposers from the same country. 
• 
It is important to note that for the participation of the network of proposers, the ITC status of 
researchers and innovators from EU Member States Outermost Regions will be counted as the 
EU Member State they are linked to12 (see Annex I – Level A : Country and Organisations 
Table). 
• 
The European Commission and EU bodies, offices or agencies, European RTD Organisations 
and International Organisations do not count as COST Full or Cooperating Members, even if 
they are geographically located in the territory of one of the COST Full or Cooperating Members. 
No letter of intention is required from any of the institutions involved in the Network of Proposers 
(Main or Secondary Proposers). 
• 
The Main Proposer acts as representative and contact point for the COST Association and is 
also in charge of inviting and accepting Secondary Proposers to the Network. Please do not 
underestimate the time necessary to complete this task as acceptance implies completion of e-
COST profiles. 
• 
All proposers must have a registered and updated e-COST profile (https://e-services.cost.eu) 
and specify their scientific expertise. Proposers should be aware that completing an e-COST 
profile may require some time.  
See also Table 1, summarising the eligibility for participation as Main and Secondary Proposers by 
affiliation. 
2.4. Proposal template 
Proposals for COST Actions have the following sections. Each section is included in the generated view 
(PDF) of the proposal depending on the role of the actor in the SESA process.  
 
 
 
12 For example, researchers affiliated in a legal entity in e.g., Guadeloupe will be counted as France (non-ITC), researchers 
affiliated in a legal entity in Azores will be counted as Portugal (ITC).

Section 1 – S&amp;T EXCELLENCE 
 
1.1 SOUNDNESS OF THE 
CHALLENGE 
Key concept: Challenge.  
These are the research questions addressed by a COST Action, targeting 
S&amp;T and/or socio-economic problems. 
In COST Actions, researchers and innovators from different places and 
backgrounds are expected to work as a team towards the resolution of a 
S&amp;T challenge. To respond to the challenge, the network needs not only 
coordination in working as a team, but also in gathering a critical mass of 
participants (researchers and innovators) around the science and 
technology topic in question. 
1.1.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE 
STATE OF THE ART 
Demonstrate a comprehensive command of the state of the art in the field. 
1.1.2 DESCRIPTION OF THE 
CHALLENGE (MAIN AIM) 
Describe the research question(s) your proposal addresses. Explain the 
relevance and timeliness of the identified challenge(s).  
1.2 PROGRESS BEYOND THE 
STATE OF THE ART 
Describe how the addressing of the identified challenge is expected to 
advance the state of the art.  
1.2.1 APPROACH TO THE 
CHALLENGE AND PROGRESS 
BEYOND THE STATE OF THE 
ART 
Describe how the challenge will be approached and emphasise the 
innovativeness of this approach, and how it will advance the state of the 
art in the field. 
1.2.2 OBJECTIVES 
Describe clear and ambitious objectives clearly showing their relevance to 
the identified challenge. Please formulate the objectives in a “SMART” 
(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely) way. Objectives 
are not COST Action networking activities (e.g., meetings, training 
schools), milestones or deliverables. Indeed, networking activities are 
means to support the achievement of the Action objectives. 
1.2.2.1 Research Coordination 
Objectives 
These objectives entail the distribution of tasks, sharing of knowledge and 
know-how, and the creation of synergies among Action Participants to 
achieve specific outputs. Achieving these objectives turns COST Actions 
from initially scattered groups into one transnational team and leverages 
the existing funded research. 
Examples of Research Coordination Objectives: 
• 
development of a common understanding/definition of the 
subject matter; 
• 
coordination of information seeking, identification, collection 
and/or data curation; 
• 
coordination of experimentation or testing; 
• 
comparison and/or performance assessment of theory/ model/ 
scenario/ 
projection/ 
simulation/ 
narrative/ 
methodology/ 
technology/ technique; 
• 
development of knowledge needing international coordination: 
new or improved theory/ model/scenario/ projection/ simulation/ 
narrative/ methodology/ technology/ technique; 
• 
achievement of a specific tangible output that cannot be 
achieved without international coordination (e.g., due to practical 
issues such as database availability, language barriers, 
availability of infrastructure or know-how, etc.); 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 16"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 16 
• 
input to stakeholders (e.g., standardization body, policy-makers, 
regulators, users) -excluding commercial applications; 
• 
input for future market applications (including cooperation with 
private enterprises); 
• 
dissemination of research results to the general public or to 
stakeholders. 
1.2.2.2 Capacity-building 
Objectives 
Achieving these objectives entails building critical mass to drive scientific 
progress, thereby strengthening the European Research Area. They can 
be achieved by the delivery of specific outputs and/or through network 
features or types and levels of participation. 
Examples of Capacity-building Objectives: 
• 
fostering knowledge exchange and the development of a joint 
research agenda around a topic of scientific and/or socio-
economic relevance; 
• 
fostering knowledge exchange and the development of a joint 
research agenda around a new or emerging field of research; 
• 
bridging separate fields of science/disciplines to achieve 
breakthroughs that requires an interdisciplinary approach; 
• 
acting as a stakeholder platform or trans-national practice 
community (by area of socio-economic application and/or market 
sector); 
• 
involving specific target groups (e.g., newly established research 
groups, Young Researchers and Innovators, the under-
represented gender, teams from countries/regions with less 
capacity in the field of the Action). 
Section 2 – NETWORKING 
EXCELLENCE 
 
2.1 ADDED VALUE OF 
NETWORKING IN S&amp;T 
EXCELLENCE 
 
2.1.1 ADDED VALUE IN 
RELATION TO EXISTING 
EFFORTS AT EUROPEAN 
AND/OR INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 
Describe the added value of the proposed COST Action in tackling the 
challenge in relation to former and existing efforts (research projects, other 
networks, etc.) at the European and/or international level. 
2.2 ADDED VALUE OF 
NETWORKING IN IMPACT 
 
2.2.1 SECURING THE CRITICAL 
MASS AND EXPERTISE AND 
GEOGRAPHICAL BALANCE 
WITHIN THE COST MEMBERS 
AND BEYOND 
Demonstrate that the proposed network contains the critical mass and 
expertise for achieving the objectives and thus addressing the challenge; 
and/ or present a credible plan for securing the critical mass and expertise 
for achieving the objectives.  
Explain why your Network of Proposers can address the identified 
challenge and objectives of the proposed COST Action: make a case for 
the critical mass, expertise and geographical distribution needed for 
addressing the challenge and the objectives, both in the COST Members 
and, if applicable, NNC, Third States (IPC) and Specific Organisations.  
If your Network misses any of the critical mass, expertise or geographical 
distribution needed, present a clear plan for overcoming the identified 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 17"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 17 
gaps. COST Policy should not be addressed in this section. See 
Chapter 2.4.4. 
2.2.2 INVOLVEMENT OF 
STAKEHOLDERS  
Identify the most relevant stakeholders and present a clear plan to involve 
them in the Action. 
Section 3 – IMPACT 
Impact is the effect or influence on short-term to long-term scientific, 
technological, and/or socio-economic changes produced by a COST 
Action. 
3.1 IMPACT TO SCIENCE, 
SOCIETY AND 
COMPETITIVENESS, AND 
POTENTIAL FOR 
INNOVATION/BREAKTHROUGHS 
Key concept: Innovation/Breakthrough.  
Through the Actions, COST aims notably at enabling breakthrough 
scientific developments leading to new concepts, services, processes and 
products and thereby contributing to strengthening Europe’s research and 
innovation capacities. 
These are the direct results stemming from the COST Action activities. 
Outputs can be, among other things, codified knowledge, tacit knowledge, 
technology, and societal applications: 
• 
Codified knowledge: Knowledge expressed through language 
(including mathematics, music etc.) and thus capable of being 
stored on a physical support (i.e., transferrable knowledge) – 
e.g., publications; patents, websites; 
• 
Tacit knowledge: Not formalised knowledge, resulting from the 
participation in the COST Action networking activities and the 
social interaction among its members that can also be re-
invested in other contexts; 
• 
Technology: Knowledge embedded in artefacts either ready to 
use or not, such as machinery or software, new materials or 
modified organisms –e.g., a prototype, a database; 
• 
Societal applications: Use of any kind of knowledge (codified, 
tacit, technology) to perform specific tasks; 
• 
Societal applications require the active participation of 
stakeholders (such as business enterprises, practitioners, 
regulators, users) within the lifetime of an Action. If stakeholders 
are not involved, then societal applications may only be 
considered as possible future impacts resulting from the 
envisaged outputs, rather than direct Action outputs (e.g., use of 
a methodology developed by the Action by a community of 
practitioners not participating to the Action). 
When choosing a COST Action as an instrument to tackle the S&amp;T 
Challenge, proposers must have a clear vision on the innovation potential 
of their endeavour. 
3.1.1. SCIENTIFIC, 
TECHNOLOGICAL, AND/OR 
SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS 
(INCLUDING POTENTIAL 
INNOVATIONS AND/OR 
BREAKTHROUGHS)  
Describe in a clear way the relevant scientific and/or technological and/or 
socio-economic impact envisaged by the proposal in the short- and long-
term perspective. Clearly identify relevant and realistic impacts for 
science, society and/or competitiveness, including potential scientific, 
technological and/or socioeconomic innovations and/or breakthroughs. 
3.2 MEASURES TO MAXIMISE 
IMPACT 
 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 18"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 18 
3.2.1. KNOWLEDGE CREATION, 
TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE 
AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT 
Clearly describe the contribution that the proposed Action would make to 
knowledge creation, transfer of knowledge and career development. 
3.2.2. PLAN FOR 
DISSEMINATION AND/OR 
EXPLOITATION AND DIALOGUE 
WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR 
POLICY 
Present a clear and attainable plan for dissemination and/or exploitation 
of results, including IPR, if relevant13. Describe a plan for dissemination 
and/or exploitation of results that is clear and attainable and contributes 
to the dialogue between science and the general public and/or policy. 
Section 4 – IMPLEMENTATION 
 
4.1 COHERENCE AND 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WORK 
PLAN 
Please note that you do not need to provide a budget breakdown at this 
stage, since the budget is allocated to the approved Actions by the COST 
Association on the basis of specific parameters and subject to budget 
availability (see Chapter 1.2). 
4.1.1 DESCRIPTION OF 
WORKING GROUPS, TASKS 
AND ACTIVITIES 
Provide a detailed description of the different Working Groups, tasks and 
activities, ensuring that these are appropriate to ensure the achievement 
of the objectives of the proposed Action. There is no need to describe the 
standard Action management structure (e.g., each COST Action is 
organised with a Management Committee led by a Chair). Specific 
structure including leadership roles which are functional to the needs of 
the proposed Action shall be described in this section.  
4.1.2. DESCRIPTION OF 
DELIVERABLES AND 
TIMEFRAME 
Describe the proposed Action’s major deliverables and timeframe, 
ensuring that these are appropriate to ensure the achievement of the 
objectives of the proposed Action.  
Deliverables are distinct, expected and tangible outputs of the Action, 
meaningful in terms of the Action’s overall objectives, such as: reports, 
documents, technical diagrams, scientific and technical papers and 
contributions, content for training schools, input to standards, best 
practices, white papers, etc. Note that COST Action deliverables are used 
to measure the Action’s progress and success on Action objectives.  
Deliverables are not COST Action networking activities (e.g., meetings, 
training schools, etc.).  
4.1.3 RISK ANALYSIS AND 
CONTINGENCY PLANS 
Identify the main risks related to the Work Plan and present a credible 
contingency plan which is appropriate to ensure the achievement of the 
objectives of the proposed Action. 
4.1.4 GANTT DIAGRAM 
Provide a graphical illustration of the time schedule for the different 
activities, tasks, milestones and deliverables according to the 
management structure of the proposed Action. 
Milestones are control points in the Action that help to map progress. They 
are needed at intermediary stages so that, if problems have arisen, 
corrective measures can be taken in a timely way.

2.5. Writing style guide 
The COST Association strongly recommends complying with the following requirements when drafting 
a proposal: 
• 
check language and spelling; 
• 
present the text in a logical way, avoiding unnecessary repetition between the different sections; 
• 
do not use footnotes; 
• 
use of capital letters for COST-specific and Action-related expressions. A non-exhaustive list: 
COST Action, Action Chair, Action Management Committee, Working Group, Short-Term 
Scientific Mission (STSM), Training School, Core Group; 
• 
explain all acronyms, including those commonly used in the Framework Programme context; 
• 
use of “Europe” or “COST Member Countries” when referring to the overall geographical scope 
of COST. “European Union” or “EU Member States” should only be used to refer to the EU as 
a player (“EU legislation”, “EU programmes”, “EU policies” etc.) or when only EU Member 
State(s) need to be explicitly mentioned, excluding COST Members that are no Member States 
of the EU; 
• 
use of “framework” or “scheme” when referring to COST (COST is an intergovernmental 
framework, not an “EU instrument”, although it is funded by the EU Framework Programme); 
• 
avoid pronouns such as “I”, “we”; rather use “the Action”; 
• 
avoid expressions such as “planned” or “proposed” when referring to the Action; rather use 
“aims at”, “will”, etc.; 
• 
avoid overstatements regarding the potential impact of the Action.

3. HOW 
COST 
PROPOSALS 
ARE 
EVALUATED, 
SELECTED AND APPROVED – CORE PRINCIPLES 
AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST RULES 
The Open Call Evaluation, Selection and Approval procedure fulfils three core principles: excellence, 
fairness and transparency. COST strives to avoid any Conflict of Interest (CoI)15 and all those involved 
in the SESA process must commit to confidentiality. 
3.1. Conflict of Interest 
COST expects an ethical behaviour from all the participants in COST activities. 
The Conflict of Interest rules apply to all those concerned by the SESA process (CNCs, Independent 
External Experts, Review Panel Members, Scientific Committee Members, and CSO members). Each 
individual involved in the evaluation, selection and approval of proposals shall have only one role in the 
evaluation, selection and approval of a COST Action and may not take any benefit from any Action 
approved under that specific Collection. In particular: 
• 
Independent External Experts having evaluated a proposal may not participate in the Action 
deriving from that proposal; 
• 
Review Panel Members may not participate in any Action approved following the evaluation 
process in which they were involved in that position; 
• 
CNCs and Scientific Committee Members may not join any Action in any way during their 
mandate;  
• 
CSO members may not join any Action in any way during their mandate.  
A Conflict of Interest can be real, potential or perceived. 
1. Cases of Real Conflict of Interest 
The person involved in the evaluation or selection procedures (Independent External Expert, Review 
Panel Member, and Scientific Committee Member): 
• 
has been involved in the preparation of the proposal;  
• 
has been involved in any previous evaluation step in the same Collection.  
2. Cases of Potential Conflict of Interest 
The person involved in the evaluation or selection procedures (Independent External Expert, Review 
Panel Member, and Scientific Committee Member): 
• 
was aware of the preparation of the proposal;  
• 
has a professional or personal relationship with a proposer; 
• 
stands to benefit directly or indirectly if the proposal shall be accepted or rejected. 
3. Cases of Perceived Conflict of Interest 
The person involved in the evaluation or selection procedures (Independent External Expert, Review 
Panel Member, Scientific Committee Member): 
• 
feels for any reason unable to provide an impartial review of the proposal.

1. If the Conflict of Interest is confirmed/identified before the evaluation starts: 
• 
the evaluator may not participate in the evaluation/selection procedure in the ongoing 
collection and shall be replaced.  
 
2. If the Conflict of Interest is confirmed/identified during the evaluation:  
• 
the evaluator shall stop evaluating/selecting in the ongoing collection and shall be 
replaced;  
• 
any comments and marks already given by the evaluator shall be discarded. 
 
3. If the Conflict of Interest is confirmed/identified after the evaluation has taken place, the COST 
Association shall examine: 
• 
the potential impact and consequences of the Conflict of Interest and take appropriate 
measures. 
 
The COST Association has the right to take the lead in any resolution process of a CoI situation at any 
moment of the evaluation and selection. 
All cases of CoI are recorded by the COST Association. All those related to nationally nominated actors 
(Review Panel Members and COST Scientific Committee Members) are reported to the COST National 
Coordinator. 
Declaration of Conflict of Interest 
Any person involved in the evaluation or selection procedures (Independent External Expert, Review 
Panel Member, and Scientific Committee Member) shall sign a declaration stating/accepting he/she: 
• 
is not aware of any conflict of interest regarding the proposal(s) to be evaluated/selected; 
• 
shall inform immediately the COST Association of any conflict of interest discovered during the 
evaluation process; 
• 
shall maintain the confidentiality of the procedure. 
Failure to declare the CoI may have the following consequences: 
• 
notification to the COST Association Director; 
• 
notification to the respective CNC for Review Panel Members; 
• 
notification to the CSO for Scientific Committee Members; 
• 
removal from the COST Expert Database.

3.2. Confidentiality16  
COST expects that each person involved in the SESA process (Independent External Expert, Review 
Panel Member, Scientific Committee Member, CNC and CSO member): 
• 
treats confidentially any information, including personal data of any natural person concerned 
by or involved in the submission, evaluation, selection and approval of the proposals process, 
and document, in any form (i.e., paper or electronic), disclosed in writing or orally in relation to 
the performance of the evaluation; 
• 
processes any confidential information or documents as described above only for the purposes 
and for the duration of the submission, evaluation, selection and approval of proposals process;  
• 
does not, either directly or indirectly, disclose any confidential information or document related 
to proposals or applicants, without prior written approval of the COST Association; 
• 
does not discuss any proposal with others, including other evaluators or staff not directly 
involved in evaluating the proposal, except during formal discussions at dedicated ad hoc 
Review Panels and Scientific Committee meetings; 
• 
does not disclose any detail of the evaluation process and its outcomes, nor of any proposal 
submitted, for any purpose other than fulfilling their tasks as evaluator; 
• 
does not disclose the names of other experts participating in the evaluation; 
• 
does not communicate with proposers on any proposal during or after the evaluation until the 
approval of CSO. 
Under no circumstances should the proposers contact any of the actors involved in the SESA process 
regarding their proposal. Any attempt to do so may lead to immediate exclusion of the proposal from 
the process. 
3.3. Proposal Evaluation, Selection and Approval 
As outlined in Chapter 1.3, the proposal Evaluation, Selection and Approval procedure is divided into 
three steps, which are described below. 
3.3.1. STEP 1 – PROPOSAL EVALUATION BY INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL 
EXPERTS: 
Independent External Experts carry out the remote peer-review evaluation. They are identified and 
assigned to proposals on the basis of their scientific and technological expertise necessary for the 
evaluation of proposals, taking into account the Research Areas and keywords selected by the network 
of proposers.  
This step uses double-blind peer review, which means the identity of both Independent External Experts 
and proposers is kept confidential. Each proposal is evaluated by a minimum of three Independent 
External Experts. The evaluation is performed remotely, and each External Expert submits an Individual 
Evaluation Report for each proposal they evaluate. One of the experts is appointed Rapporteur, with 
the responsibility to coordinate the preparation and submission of the Consensus Evaluation Report. 
Following the submission of the Individual Evaluation Reports, a consensus is sought among the 
External Experts (remotely) and a Consensus Evaluation Report is drafted. Consensus shall not be 
imposed, and External Experts may maintain their views on the proposal. In the cases where no 
consensus is reached, the three Individual Evaluation Reports will be sent to the ad hoc Review Panel 
which is in charge of the quality check and resolution of discrepancies. 
The Individual Evaluation Reports are structured as follows: 
• 
eligibility criteria

</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 24"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 24 
• 
evaluation criteria 
o 
S&amp;T Excellence 
o 
Networking Excellence 
o 
Impact 
o 
Implementation. 
The Independent External Experts check the following eligibility criteria (see Chapter 2.2 of this 
document): 
• 
Length of the Technical Annex; 
• 
Anonymity; 
• 
Respect of fundamental ethical principles with special emphasis on peaceful purposes; 
• 
Language (English). 
The table below presents the evaluation criteria, as well as the respective maximum marks at this stage 
of the procedure. The overall threshold for access to the selection stage is also indicated. 
Table 7: Evaluation criteria and maximum mark per criterion

TOTAL MARKS AWARDED = 0 – 50 points 
OVERALL THRESHOLD = 34 points 
 
Proposals failing to achieve the overall threshold will not be funded. 
Table 8 shows the specific questions addressed by the Independent External Experts on each of the 
criteria. 
Table 8: Evaluation questions addressed by the Independent External Experts 
S&amp;T EXCELLENCE CRITERIA 
Soundness of the Challenge 
Q1: Does the proposal demonstrate a comprehensive command of the state of the art in the field(s) and 
present a relevant and timely challenge? 
Progress beyond the state-of-the-art. 
Q2: Does the proposal describe an innovative approach to the challenge that advances the state of the art 
in the field(s)? 
Q3: Are the objectives presented relevant to the challenge, clear and ambitious? 
NETWORKING EXCELLENCE CRITERIA 
Added value of networking in S&amp;T Excellence  
Q4: Does networking bring added value in tackling the challenge in relation to existing efforts at the European 
and/or international level? 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 25"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 25 
Added value of networking in Impact  
Q5: Does the proposed network contain, or present a credible plan for securing, the critical mass and range 
of expertise for achieving the objectives and thus addressing the challenge? 
Q6: Does the proposal identify the most relevant stakeholders and present a clear plan to involve them as 
Action participants? 
IMPACT CRITERIA 
Impact to science, society and competitiveness, and potential for innovation/breakthroughs 
Q7: Does the proposal clearly identify relevant and realistic impacts for science, society and/or 
competitiveness (including potential innovations and/or breakthroughs)? 
Measures to maximise impact  
Q8: Does the proposed networking clearly contribute to knowledge creation, transfer of knowledge and 
career development? 
Q9: Is the plan for dissemination and/or exploitation of results clear and attainable and does it contribute to 
the dialogue between science and the general public or policy? 
IMPLEMENTATION CRITERION 
Coherence and effectiveness of the work plan 
Q10: Is the work plan (WGs, tasks, activities, timeframe, deliverables and risk analysis) appropriate to ensure 
the achievement of the objectives? 
3.3.2. STEP 2 – REVISION AND QUALITY CHECK BY AD HOC REVIEW PANEL 
Ad hoc Review Panels are set up after each Collection Date, based on the number of received proposals 
and on the topics covered. 
The members of the ad hoc Review Panels are appointed by the COST Association from a pool of active 
researchers and innovators who have been nominated by the CNCs. Step 2 again uses double-blind 
peer review, which means that the identity of both Review Panel Members and proposers is kept 
confidential. 
The ad hoc Review Panels shall: 
a) ensure the quality of the Consensus Evaluation Reports and marks submitted in Step 1; 
b) resolve the differences in opinions among the Independent External Experts, using one of the 
following options: 
• 
choose any mark within the range of marks awarded by the individual Independent External 
Experts or the non-agreed consensus mark of the Rapporteur as the review consensus marks, 
produce and validate the Consensus Evaluation Report; 
• 
in exceptional cases, ask for one or two additional Independent External Experts to remotely 
evaluate the proposal. In this case the ad hoc Review Panel shall make use of the additional 
evaluation reports to prepare the validated Consensus Evaluation Report and marks; 
c) rank the proposals above the overall threshold; 
d) strive for consistency of marking across the proposals within and across the Review Panels; 
e) identify those proposals which address emerging issues or potentially important future 
developments; 
f) prepare the report for the Scientific Committee, reflecting the process and the decisions of Step 2.

3.3.3. STEP 3 – PROPOSALS SELECTION BY COST SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
The Scientific Committee is composed of high-level experts (one from each COST Full Member and 
one from the Cooperating Member) with internationally renowned expertise and recognised merit in their 
professional career (science, technology, research management, innovation, industry or other). 
Scientific Committee Members are appointed by, and report to, the CSO. 
The Scientific Committee guarantees that the present rules and procedures are observed and 
documented throughout all the SESA process. Specifically, it is in charge of: 
• 
establishing the shortlist of proposals that shall be submitted to the CSO for approval by  
o 
adopting from the ranked shortlist of proposals provided by the Review panels a list of 
retained proposals, which include all proposals with marks: 
▪ 
above the cut-off mark* (A); 
▪ 
equal to the cut-off mark*, one point less than the cut-off mark* or two points 
less than the cut-off mark* (B); and 
*the cut-off mark is the number of points of the Nth proposal in the ranked list (sorted 
in decreasing order according to number of points), with N being the number of 
proposals to be funded according to available funds)  
 
o 
selecting from the list of retained proposals the shortlist of proposals for approval by the 
CSO: 
▪ 
the proposals in A (above the cut-off mark*) automatically enter the list of 
proposals recommended for funding;  
▪ 
among the proposals in B (equal to the cut-off mark*, one point less than the 
cut-off mark* or two points less than the cut-off mark*) the Scientific Committee 
completes the list of proposals recommended for funding with those that, 
besides being highly marked with respect to S&amp;T Excellence/Networking 
Excellence / Impact / Implementation (i.e. the mark established by the Review 
Panels), best respond to COST Mission and Policy, based on the description 
in the proposal on COST Mission and Policy, as described in Chapter 2.4.4 
COST Mission and Policy of the present Guidelines. In order to achieve that, 
the Scientific Committee applies a pass / no-pass mark to all the proposals in B 
based on the criteria 2.b-2.d that are described in Chapter 7 of document COST 
101/21 “COST Action Proposal Submission, Evaluation, Selection and 
Approval”. Each Main Proposer in proposals under B receives a notification 
that their proposal has been grouped among the proposals in B and that the 
final mark consists of the mark established by the Review Panels and the 
pass / no-pass mark established by the Scientific Committee. A separate 
comment on the pass / no-pass mark is provided by the Scientific Committee 
to each Main Proposer in proposals under B, additionally to the Consensus 
Evaluation Report.  
• 
deciding on eligibility of proposals that have been identified by the COST Administration, the 
External Experts or the Review Panels as potentially breaching the COST principles; 
For all proposals recommended for funding the Scientific Committee adopts a Recommendation on 
COST Mission and Policy. 
3.3.4. PROPOSAL APPROVAL BY THE COMMITTEE OF SENIOR OFFICIALS 
(CSO) 
The final decision on approval and funding for new COST Actions is taken by the CSO, on the basis of 
the shortlist submitted by the Scientific Committee taking into account the available budget. The CSO 
may decide not to approve Actions selected through the procedure above described. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 27"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 27 
The text of a successful proposal approved by the CSO will form the basis of the Action’s Memorandum 
of Understanding (MoU). The procedure for starting a COST Action is described in the Annotated Rules 
for COST Actions. 
3.4. Feedback to proposers 
The Consensus Evaluation Reports, the marks of the evaluation and the results of the assessments 
made by the SC under Chapter 3.3.3 are made available to all proposers via e-COST. The decision on 
the approved proposals is communicated after the CSO decision to the Main Proposers. 
3.5. Redress Procedure 
In order to contribute to the fairness and transparency of the SESA process, the COST Association has 
established a Redress Procedure. The Main Proposer has the possibility to submit a request for redress 
within 15 calendar days after being notified of the proposal non-eligibility and/or following the 
communication of the result of the evaluation. 
Redress is allowed only in case of alleged procedural shortcomings and factual errors, i.e., whenever: 
• 
the Network of Proposers considers that the evaluation has not been carried out in accordance 
with the SESA process procedure; 
• 
the Network of Proposers deems that the Consensus Evaluation Report bears factual errors. 
Requests for redress dealing with the scientific judgment by the Independent External Experts, 
by the ad hoc Review Panels or Scientific Committee members are not admissible. 
The proposal Selection by the COST Scientific Committee (Step 3, Chapter 3.3.3) shall not be open to 
redress.  
The redress procedure may be initiated only by email sent to redress@cost.eu. In the email, the Main 
Proposer shall: 
• 
indicate the proposal number and title; 
• 
provide a detailed description of the alleged procedural shortcoming(s) and /or factual error(s). 
The outcome of the redress procedure is definitive. 
4. HONORARIA 
Honoraria17 shall be paid to the Independent External Experts and ad-hoc Review Panels’ members 
involved in the SESA procedure as follows: 
1. Independent External Experts: EUR 50 per proposal, an additional EUR 50 for the Rapporteur;  
2. Review Panel members: EUR 400 per Collection Date. 
 
5. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
