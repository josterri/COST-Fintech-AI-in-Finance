TECHNICAL ANNEX
OVERVIEW
Summary
The financial sector is the largest user of digital technologies and a major driver in the digital transformation
of the economy. Financial technology (FinTech) aims to both compete with and support the established
financial industry in the delivery of financial services. Globally, more than $100 billion of investments have
been made into FinTech companies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) since 2010, and continue growing
substantially. In early 2018, the European Commission unveiled (a) their action plan for a more competitive
and innovative financial market, and (b) an initiative on AI with the aim to harness the opportunities
presented by technology-enabled innovations. Europe should become a global hub for FinTech, with the
economy being able to benefit from the European Single Market.
The Action will investigate AI and Fintech from three different angles: Transparency in FinTech, Transparent
versus Black Box Decision-Support Models in the Financial Industry and Transparency into Investment
Product Performance for Clients. The Action will bridge the gap between academia, industry, the public and
governmental organisations by working in an interdisciplinary way across Europe and focusing on innovation.
The key objectives are:
to improve transparency of AI supported processes in the Fintech space
to address the disparity between the proliferation in AI models within the financial industry for risk
assessment and decision-making, and the limited insight the public has in its consequences by
developing policy papers and methods to increase transparency
to develop methods to scrutinize the quality of products, especially rule-based “smart beta” ones,
across the asset management, banking and insurance industries.

Specific Objectives
To achieve the main objective described in this MoU, the following specific objectives shall be
accomplished:
Research Coordination
●To develop blended approaches to evaluate innovative financial services and their providers, especially in
the FinTech domain, building on Machine Learning methods, focussing on prediction (early warning) of
operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal behaviour ranging from appropriation of loaned funds to money-
laundering activities.
●The development of conceptual and methodological tools for establishing when black-box models are
admissible and, to the extent possible, making them more transparent and/or replacing them with
interpretable and explainable models.
●To receive input from regulators and practitioners&#x27; communities and to validate results with regard to
increasing transparency of artificial intelligence applications.
●Pruning and improvement of the vast array of performance attribution models by contributing to the
development of methodologies for reducing the false discovery rate in financial research and applied
financial investment management.
●Disseminate to the public and share with regulators the results on investment product performance

evaluation.
●Creation of the first European platform comparing the out-of-sample performance of banks&#x27; investment
products, insurance-linked investment products and asset management products available to the general
public.
Capacity Building
●Create an excellent network of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the lifetime of the
Action.
●Bringing technological, quantitative and economic researchers together, to tackle future research that can
only be done in an interdisciplinary setting, and getting actively involved in the blockchain and FinTech
communities across Europe, to constantly monitor developments, get input and disseminate results.
●Bridging the gap between practitioners from the finance industry, academics and regulators by setting up
a common knowledge exchange platform.
●Transfer knowledge in terms of expertise, scientific tools and human resources across the different
disciplines and between academia and industry.
●Establish an inclusive community of researchers on methodological and technological themes in Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence, to promote Early Career Investigators and increase their visibility.
●Overcome the siloing of research topics by country and achieve geographical and demographical
diversity, with special attention to COST Inclusiveness Target countries.
●Prepare competitive European researchers for a fruitful career in an international environment through
intensive use of Short Term Scientific Missions (STSM) and joint educational programs with industrial
partners.
● Maximize the job opportunities for PhD students and Early Career Investigators.
●Disseminate the results of the Action&#x27;s activities to the scientific community, European institutions and to
the general public.
● Significantly improve the gender equality in the fields of the Action.

TECHNICAL ANNEX 
1 
S&amp;T EXCELLENCE 
1.1 
SOUNDNESS OF THE CHALLENGE  
1.1.1 
DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART 
There will be three related themes in FinAI, each of which will be tackled by a working group (WG). The 
state of the art with respect to each of the three themes is described here below. 
WG1 –Transparency in FinTech  
Several emerging technologies have significant potential to change the financial system and industry. 
Examples of such technologies are those based on the blockchain, which essentially allows for secure 
decentralized book-keeping. A blockchain is a distributed database of hash coded records of all 
transactions or digital events that have occurred, shared among participating parties (De Filippi and 
Hassan, 2016). Each record in this database is verified by the participants through a majority consensus 
and, once confirmed, the transaction cannot be altered or deleted (see for e.g. Tasca and Hayes, 2016). 
Crypto currencies are one of the first applications. In the last decade, operating independently of central 
banks, they have massively grown in popularity and price, but the latter has also been very volatile. The 
financial industry is especially interested in asset tokenization to create liquidity and additional 
distribution channels for previously illiquid assets. In some European countries, large established 
companies offer custody and related services for tokenized assets, enabling access for institutional 
investors. Technological innovation, in parallel to a steep increase in the regulatory oversight of banks, 
has also promoted forms of disintermediation (diminished role of traditional financial intermediaries) and 
the rise of alternative financial intermediaries, such as crowdfunding and “peer-to-peer” (P2P) lending 
platforms. While these forms of FinTech credit still represent a small fraction of overall credit, they are 
growing very rapidly and account for a large share of activity in specific credit market segments.  
These developments can lead to cheaper access to financial resources and investment opportunities 
but also less transparency in the financial system. While many acknowledge the potential benefits in 
terms of improving market efficiency (completing markets), regulators remain cautious. For example, a 
recent report by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission warns that “as these arrangements 
and the parties involved operate online and may not be regulated, investors may be exposed to 
heightened risks of fraud”. The regulatory approach, however, varies greatly, including across Europe. 
For example, some regulators treat initial coin offerings (ICOs) as regulated securities, which improves 
their quality and reduces the risk of frauds, others simply warn investors of their risks. 
WG2 – Transparent versus Black Box Decision-Support Models in the Financial Industry 
Regulators do not accept non-transparent “black box” models developed for any aspect of risk exposure. 
For example, some AI approaches – typically based on machine learning techniques – have not yet 
received full acceptance by regulators even though they are successfully applied internally by banks. 
The resulting incentive towards model simplicity bears however some risks: 1) overly simplified models 
might not apply to the evaluation of some of the more complex modern financial products, creating an 
indirect and perhaps unintended barrier to financial innovation; 2) regulators and the public using overly 
simplified models might be left with inferior information about true risk exposures, including systemic 
risks. Additionally, while AI and machine learning tools hold the potential to improve risk management, 
they remain untested at addressing risk under shifting financial conditions because they have been only 
recently deployed. 
 
 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 6"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
       2 
A serious investment into transparent, interpretable and explainable AI in Finance is therefore urgently 
needed. Such research would encourage regulators to consider and apply more advanced AI-based 
models. Consequently, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an emergent and very important 
research area. It not only aims at providing a rationale for model selection but also creates stability in 
model formulation, an important requirement for trust in models (Došilović et al. 2018, Biran et al. 2018). 
WG3 – Transparency into Investment Product Performance for Clients 
Active investment products collectively are often unable to offer outperformance relative to passive 
products like ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), that are cheaper in terms of fees because they simply 
replicate broad market indices. Especially so-called &quot;smart beta&quot; strategies offered by banks have 
systematically underperformed. An empirical analysis of Suhonen et al. (2016) demonstrated an 
endemic “overfitting” of banks&#x27; investment strategies in their development phase and their significant 
underperformance after they go live. Lopez de Prado and Lewis (2018) attribute this effect to a 
&quot;proliferation of false discoveries&quot; about sources of investment performance and calls it &quot;the greatest 
threat faced by finance as an industry and an academic discipline&quot;. Institutional investors use the 
experience and expertise of specialized investment consultant companies like Mercer, Willis Towers 
Watson and Siglo to assess potential investments, but private clients and smaller investors do not have 
access to this. Academic statistical publications offer methods to quantify the overfitting problem, but 
these methods require data about &quot;failed trials&quot; only available to the product vendors. 
As a consequence of the ex-ante difficulty for investors to screen active investment managers and the 
ex-post underperformance of actively managed investment funds relative to passive investment 
strategies, the former have experienced a substantial outflow of assets under management in favour of 
the latter. This has led to a substantial reduction in expensive independent research activities, which 
only active funds can afford. Active managers publicly warn that this can result in a decrease in market 
efficiency.  
1.1.2 
DESCRIPTION OF THE CHALLENGE (MAIN AIM) 
WG1 –Transparency in FinTech  
A first point of concern with respect to blockchain applications in finance is that of fraudulent Initial Coin 
Offerings. International regulatory authorities have raised many concerns, particularly in the context of 
investor protection, suggesting that, in most cases, investors do not adequately understand the risk 
involved with ICOs. Although many legitimate start-ups use ICOs for the purpose of raising money, the 
market has seen many cases of fraudulent ICOs which in turn raises many concerns for investor 
protection and overall financial stability. If ICOs qualify as financial instruments, there are several 
existing European pieces of legislations which FinTechs need to comply with, including the Prospectus 
Directive, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the Alternative Investment Fund 
Managers Directive (AIFMD) and the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (European Securities and 
Markets Authority, 2017). Nevertheless, there are many contexts in which ICOs fall outside the scope 
of laws and regulations. The European Securities and Markets Authority has argued that the hype 
concerning ICOs, virtual currencies and blockchain technology can lead to speculative behaviour in 
which only very limited attention is paid to the underlying project and the risks associated with it. 
Another cause of concern is that crypto assets allow for a multi-billion dollars global market of 
anonymous transactions, which is not subjected to supervision. Hence, its growth can create 
considerable challenges for market integrity, particularly coming from money laundering activities. 
Money laundering embraces all those operations to disguise the illicit origin of capital, to give it a 
semblance of legitimacy, and facilitate the subsequent reinvestment in the lawful economy. 
In P2P lending, fraudulent behaviour by P2P platforms was recently shown to be a large-scale problem 
in China following a tightening of regulatory oversight, and might become (or might even be already) a 
problem elsewhere, including in Europe.  
More generally, in many of the emerging market segments and activities commonly referred to as 
FinTech (seen as a sector of the financial industry), there is great need for transparency about fund 
flows, activities, intermediaries and risks. Lacking this transparency, the emerging sectors will not 
develop in full and there will be system-wide risks to financial stability and integrity.

WG2 – Transparent versus Black Box Models in the Financial Industry 
Regulators need to ensure the transparency of rules and criteria used to judge the admissibility of 
decision algorithms employed by financial institutions, to avoid possible negative impact on the industry 
such as discrimination among market players.Thus, it is important that regulators and policy-makers 
have conceptual tools and research at their disposals to make quick and motivated decisions on how to 
regulate the use of data science techniques. 
Additionally, while AI and ML tools hold potential to improve risk management, their recent deployment 
means that they remain untested at addressing risk under shifting financial conditions. Moreover, for 
more novel asset classes such as those comprising exposure to crypto-assets, the lack of long time 
series compounds the difficulty of understanding how a given model performs. Thus, it is important to 
develop methodologies to make inferences on model performance in unstable environments and in the 
absence of long time series (e.g., along the lines of Athey and Kuang (2018)).  
Another point of concern is that black-box models can (inadvertently or otherwise) introduce biases in 
decision making within the financial industry that can have important discriminatory effects, as stressed 
by Kusner, M.; Loftus, C.; Russell, C. and Silva, R. (2017). For example, credit scoring models might 
discriminate based on race and socio-cultural characteristics that might be correlated but not have any 
direct causal link to individuals&#x27; creditworthiness.  
WG3 – Transparency into Investment Product Performance for Clients 
The investment challenge for clients is the decision between passively and actively managed products 
of both asset managers and banks. This decision however requires data and methods for evaluating 
investment performance, which give rise to an analytic and a data challenge, respectively.  
Starting from the data challenge, this arises because judging the risk-adjusted performance of the 
products requires estimating their risk as well as their (expected) return. This requires long time series 
of returns on the products, otherwise valid statistical inferences on risk -adjusted performance would be 
impossible. This however poses a data availability problem because, while investment fund time series 
are widely available as their net asset values (NAVs) must be published with regular frequency, other 
financial products usually have a fixed expiry date and are invisible after their expiry. To circumvent this 
problem, the calculation of indices that replicate the payoffs of the products over time is required. This, 
in turn, requires long time series of data on prices of underlying assets and market conditions (risk 
factors), which must be collected and stored for each product. Some of the required information, such 
as execution costs for the implementation of the strategies underlying the products, is also not readily 
observable and must be modelled or otherwise inferred.  
In terms of methodology, one key challenge is that the &quot;failed trials&quot; produced during the development 
process are not known to any other party who was not involved in this development process. In these 
situations, the analytical tools reviewed by Bailey and Lopez de Prado (2014), Bailey et al. (2015) and 
Lopez de Prado and Lewis (2018), among others, are not applicable. In contrast to the product 
development process in the pharmaceutical industry, there is also no regulation on how to set up a 
backtest, which also requires the choice of an appropriate benchmark, what data needs to be stored to 
ensure replicability, how to test parameter sensitivity and how to deal with failed trials. Hence, the 
analytic challenge is to provide industry and regulators with guidance on how to deal with these 
methodological issues and how formulate the necessary regulation, respectively. 
Overall, the scientific challenge and main aim for this WG is thus to propose consistent and reliable 
methods, together with the necessary data, for choosing investment products ex-ante and evaluating 
ex-post their performance.  
1.2 
PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART  
1.2.1 
APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGE AND PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART 
This Action will improve upon the state-of-the-art in all the three subfields of our research agenda. 
WG1 –Transparency in FinTech  
To increase transparency about both risks and opportunities, the WG will first assemble databases on 
the main FinTech activities, especially ICOs and by P2P lending. Regarding ICOs, the database will 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 8"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
       4 
contain data about past ICOs, their pre-ICO documentation and the post-ICO performance. The pre-
ICO documentation will be obtained directly from issuers and the post-ICO performance data will be 
obtained from crypto exchanges, as well as from existing databases of specialized data providers. The 
database on crowdfunding/P2P platforms will include data on custodian and settlement arrangements 
and practices, on the governance structure and other features useful to predict fraudulent behaviour.  
Based on these databases, criteria to evaluate ICOs and crowdfunding/P2P lending platforms will be 
identified using both quantitative and qualitative inputs and methods with different degree of 
formalization (e.g., from judgemental forecasting, drawing on the insight of experienced stakeholders, 
to formal ML classifiers). Insight from diverse sources of information and methods will be blended using 
and extending methodologies that rely on Bayesian learning (e.g., Figini and Giudici (2011)). In this 
setting, expert judgemental forecasting will be given more weight (as more useful/reliable) when 
available databases are small (e.g., short time series) whereas a quantitative rating approach using 
supervised learning methods will become increasingly informative as the databases grow.  
The Action will also apply and extend text mining analytics methods that use network models to reduce 
the curse of dimensionality. For example, most recent statistics show that 99% of all ICOs use Telegram 
as a channel for interacting with communities of investors. By collecting data from the Telegram ICOs 
(including the corresponding white papers) and discussions on Telegram chats regarding the value and 
prospects of the projects in question, it will be possible to build, train and test supervised models to 
discriminate and classify ICOs by their probability of fraud.  
Furthermore, the public availability of blockchain data makes it possible to apply network-based 
community detection models in the context of anti-money laundering (AML). These models exploit the 
transactional network topology for the purpose of identifying communities of users and, in particular, to 
identify communities of money launderers, using the transactions between them. The method that will 
be applied for money laundering detection is therefore a network cluster analysis algorithm that takes 
as inputs the set of users (“nodes” in network terminology) and the trades between users (“edges” or 
“links” in network terminology) (Foley et al., 2018). The output of the algorithm is an assignment of users 
to communities such that the “modularity” of the communities (density of links within communities and 
sparsity of links between communities) is maximized (Foley et al., 2018). 
WG2 – Transparent versus Black Box Models in the Financial Industry 
With regard to all three challenges faced by WG2 (listed in sub-section 1.1.2), key insight will come from 
research on the nexus between causality and prediction, which is currently being explored in pioneering 
literature at the cross-roads of econometrics and data science, such as the work of Victor Chernozhukov 
(e.g., Belloni et al. (2017)) and of Susan Athey and Guido Imbens (e.g., Athey (2017), Athey and Imbens 
(2019)). The Action will build on and expand this line of research, leveraging on the multidisciplinary 
nature of the network (economists and financial economists working alongside applied mathematicians, 
statisticians and computer scientists). 
During this Action, the working group will develop prototypes to demonstrate the application of 
quantitative methods to improve transparency for the described &quot;black box&quot; models. The working group 
will also publish policy papers to suggest new regulation and guidelines for industry. The objective is to 
lower, to the extent possible, the barriers to use more advanced methods. 
In addition, the work will also address the issues of limited data and small-sample problems that arise 
in situations when the events of interest occur infrequently (e.g., defaults, fraud, etc.), providing solutions 
that will augment existing methods used in the financial industry. The WG will employ methods drawn 
from econometrics and statistics to transparently quantify and, to the extent possible, alleviate the 
impact of this problem on inference and prediction for financial decision making. This can be done, for 
example, by explicitly modelling the probability of data unavailability (e.g., using penalized logistic 
regressions and/or censored regressions), or by using estimation methods that allow for missing data 
(unbalanced panel data models). 
WG3 – Transparency into Investment Product Performance for Clients 
First, this WG will address the data availability challenge. The WG will collect time series data on 
investment funds, insurance-linked investment products and banks&#x27; products, their underlying assets 
and relevant market conditions (risk factors). This will be done with the objective of directly estimate the 
risk-adjusted performance, whether directly or, when this will not possible (please see discussion of the 
challenge), by first calculating indices that replicate the payoffs of the products and estimating their 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 9"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
       5 
execution and liquidation costs over time. Some of the data will be directly collected from exchanges 
and websites and it will be possible to freely exchange it within the network. Other parts of the data will 
be protected by IP from data vendors. Therefore, a strategy to develop algorithms, distribute these 
within the working group and then run them on the de-centrally stored data will be developed.  
Despite this data collection effort, the WG will face a limited data availability problem for some products 
and/or markets and performance attribution factors. To mitigate this problem, the WG will draw from 
methods developed by WG2 and contribute to their development. 
Once the data availability challenge is addressed, the analytic challenge will be tackled. Researchers in 
the WG, like in many real-world settings, will not have access to the &quot;failed trials&quot; of the product 
developers, which implies that it will not be possible to apply the methods from the literature reviewed 
and systematized by Bailey and Lopez de Prado (2014), Bailey et al. (2015) and Lopez de Prado and 
Lewis (2018). A mitigation measure will be to simulate the development process of rule-based financial 
products by using generic versions of published factors and then to derive tweaked versions of these 
implementations until the performance characteristics of published backtested time series of real 
investment products are matched. The WG will work to automatize this &quot;tweaking&quot; process with machine 
learning approaches. The artificially generated &quot;failed trials&quot; then serve as input to use the published 
methodologies of Bailey and Lopez des Prado to quantify the &quot;overfitting bias&quot;.  
1.2.2 
OBJECTIVES 
1.2.2.1 Research Coordination Objectives 
The main objectives of each of the three working group are as follows.  
WG1 –Transparency in FinTech  
The main objectives of the working group are the following: 
 To develop blended approaches to evaluate innovative financial services and their providers, 
especially in the FinTech domain (primarily but not exclusively ICOs, P2P lending platforms and 
crowdfunding initiatives), building on machine learning methods for preemptive risk analysis and 
rating. The focus will be on prediction (early warning) of operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal 
behaviour ranging from appropriation of loaned funds (including through Ponzi-type schemes) to 
money-laundering activities. Pursuit of this objective will be assisted by compiling dedicated 
structured databases (as described in section 1.2.1) to support the large-scale application of the 
above- mentioned methods.  
The long-term goal is to improve the quality and transparency of FinTech and of the digital assets space 
especially in Europe, to facilitate their growth in the interest of European investors and of the European 
economy more widely. 
WG2 – Transparent versus Black Box Models in the Financial Industry 
The main objectives of the working group are 
 The development of conceptual and methodological tools for establishing when black-box models 
are admissible and, to the extent possible, making them more transparent and/or replacing them 
with interpretable and explainable models. This will require (i) the classification of algorithms from 
a range of disciplinary domains (especially ML, Econometrics) according to the predictability of 
the variables being modelled/forecast, (ii) the identification of methods for mapping results of 
black-box models to explainable and interpretable ones, at least ex-post, (iii) a better 
understanding of the conceptual and empirical nexus between identification of causality within 
models and the interpretability/explainability of the models.  
 To receive input from regulators and practitioners&#x27; communities and to validate results with regard 
to increasing transparency of artificial intelligence applications.

       6 
WG3 – Transparency into Investment Product Performance for Clients 
The main objectives of the working group are: 
 Pruning and improvement of the vast array of performance attribution models by contributing to 
the development of methodologies for reducing the false discovery rate in financial research and 
applied financial investment management (long-term scientific impact) 
 Creation of the first European platform comparing the out-of-sample performance of banks&#x27; 
investment products, insurance-linked investment products and asset management products 
available to the general public (industry impact).  
 Disseminate to the public and share with regulators the results on investment product 
performance evaluation. 
1.2.2.2 Capacity-building Objectives 
The capacity-building aim of the three working groups is to offer an opportunity for researchers at 
different stages to collaborate and network with other researchers and practitioners from regulatory 
bodies and the financial industry. It is intended that all three working groups will develop into long- term 
stakeholder platforms, coordinating efforts to improve transparency of financial markets (especially 
FinTech activities) through AI. The precise objectives are: 
 Create an excellent network of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the 
lifetime the Action 
 Bringing technological, quantitative and economic researchers together, to tackle future 
research that can only be done in an interdisciplinary setting, and getting actively involved in 
the blockchain and FinTech communities across Europe, to constantly monitor 
developments, get input and disseminate results 
 Bridging the gap between practitioners from the finance industry, academics and regulators by 
setting up a common knowledge exchange platform 
 Transfer knowledge in terms of expertise, scientific tools and human resources across the 
different disciplines and between academia and industry 
 Establish an inclusive community of researchers on methodological and technological themes in 
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, to promote Early Career Investigators and increase 
their visibility 
 Overcome the &#x27;siloing&#x27; of research topics by country and achieve geographical and demographical 
diversity, with a special attention to COST Inclusiveness Target countries 
 Prepare competitive EU researchers for a fruitful career in an international environment through 
intensive use of Short Term Scientific Missions (STSM) and joint educational programs with 
industrial partners 
 Maximize the job opportunities for PhD students and Early Career Investigators 
 Disseminate the results of the Action activities to the scientific community, European institutions 
and to the general public 
 Significantly improve the gender equality in the fields of the Action

NETWORKING EXCELLENCE 
2.1 
ADDED VALUE OF NETWORKING IN S&amp;T EXCELLENCE 
2.1.1 
ADDED VALUE IN RELATION TO EXISTING EFFORTS AT EUROPEAN AND/OR 
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 
This Action network is unique in its composition, through which it can actively achieve a wide scope in 
terms of research expertise and international and sectoral diversity, so that it can address Fintech in a 
way that can maximally benefit society and the European economy. 
The main focus is the transparency of the new methods and of investment products, which is an under-
researcher topic. There is no scientific network at the European level focussing on it. Compared to the 
ITN “Training for Big Data in Financial Research and Risk Management”, which explores the application 
of Data Science to financial decision making, this Action has a much broader scope. This is because 
the Action concerns itself with the overall financial industry and all its stakeholders in a very 
interdisciplinary setting rather than focussing only on investment and risk management. A further 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 11"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
       7 
difference is that the Action will explore the application of the entirety of data science methods in a 
financial domain, rather than only in settings involving big data. This is important because the novelty of 
recent data science methods also arises from the applicability to unconventional datasets (e.g., 
unstructured and mixed quantitative/qualitative data), which are not necessarily large. To some degree 
related to this Action is also the COST Action CA15109 European Cooperation for Statistics of Network 
Data Science (COSTNET) but it does not address financial industry issues specifically. 
Very importantly, the European Commission has released a FinTech Action plan in March 2018 and a 
European initiative on Artificial Intelligence in April 2018. The Action aims, to address the issues and 
goals by the European Commission. In addition, there are important synergies between the 
Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy, the EU’s cybersecurity strategy, the eIDAS Regulation 
and financial services initiatives such as the Consumer Financial Services Action Plan and the Capital 
Markets Union (CMU) mid-term Review. In February 2018, the EU has also launched the EU blockchain 
observatory and forum. It will highlight key developments of the blockchain technology, promote 
European actors and reinforce European engagement with multiple stakeholders involved in blockchain 
activities. The Action builds on these initiatives and contributes and is complementary to them. 
2.2 
ADDED VALUE OF NETWORKING IN IMPACT 
2.2.1 
SECURING THE CRITICAL MASS AND EXPERTISE  
The core strength of the Action lies in its network, which has a diverse yet carefully calibrated 
composition both across disciplines and across sectors. In terms of disciplines, the team is balanced 
between Economics and Business, Computer and Information Sciences, and Mathematics. In addition, 
the Action benefits from participation of specialists in Electrical engineering, Electronic engineering, 
Information engineering and Financial Law. Many of the participants have themselves a multidisciplinary 
background. For example, many of the participants with a Finance background based at 
Business/Management schools or departments also have a legal and accounting background (as 
traditionally the case in Finance departments at Business Schools in many countries in continental 
Europe). Many of them work in departments alongside colleagues from Law (e.g., in Management and 
Law departments) and will be able to draw additional legal expertise (involving Law colleagues in the 
network) as needed.  
In terms of sectors, the team includes participants from academia, industry and the public sector (legal 
and regulatory entities). Within industry, the partners are drawn from the financial sector and the ICT 
sector, and the majority are Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs). Many of the network proposers 
(whether from academia or industry) are internationally recognized experts in their fields. 
In forming the network, special attention has been paid to ensure that each node has critical mass to 
engage productively with the remaining nodes and exert &#x27;gravitational pull&#x27; in the country and sector to 
which the node belongs. While there are no obvious gaps in the Action network in terms of expertise, 
sectoral and geographical exposure, the Action will actively seek to involve new members throughout 
its life. This can easily be achieved thanks to the open architecture of the Action, relying on the 
established connections to different stakeholder groups of the network proposers.  
2.2.2 
INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS 
The Action will engage the following stakeholder groups: 
 Researchers, scholars and experts from universities, research institutes and companies, both 
from within the core group of proposers and beyond, to carry out state-of-the-art research and 
provide world-class solutions  
 Policy makers, regulatory and supervisory authorities at the EU, national and local level. They will 
be invited to participate in the network and take part to its events, including special joint 
workshops, to establish a mutually beneficial dialogue that can help improve the understanding 
and regulation of the Fintech sector 
 Industry players, including 
 firms involved in credit risk modelling, financial software development and risk management 
 Fintech companies, with a special attention to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs), 
as providers of financial services related to FinTech, such as research, algorithm 
development, legal and financial consulting, 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 12"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
       8 
 banks, asset manager and insurance companies, to help the network identify the key problems 
they face and how they are impacted by the rise of FinTech. 
They will be involved to allow them to exchange knowledge with academia and regulators and for 
the network to receive feedback on ongoing initiatives, findings and research 
 NGOs, citizens engaged in science and citizen science organizations. They will be regularly 
involved and updated on the progress of the Action and its research output, which will be essential 
for the network to receive feedback on the deliverables, in terms of their public acceptance and 
level of understanding. 
The consortium of participants for this Action is very large, not only geographically, but also in terms of 
disciplinary spread and type of stakeholders. Therefore, at the beginning of this Action, the 
Management Committee (MC henceforth) will prepare a detailed stakeholder engagement strategy 
which will be carefully maintained and updated on an annual basis, to ensure a high involvement of the 
most relevant stakeholders.  
As part of the same strategy, from the beginning of FinAI and throughout its duration, the MC will identify 
the target stakeholder groups for which there are a lower number of initial participants and will prepare 
an engagement plan, which will be continuously updated and maintained to monitor progress, take 
corrective actions and identify new and upcoming relevant stakeholders. The objective will be to ensure 
that at any time the most relevant stakeholders are involved in FinAI as work group members and 
through participation in the different activities, such as workshops, industry days, conferences, etc. The 
overall stakeholder engagement strategy will be inter-disciplinary and strongly inclusive, complemented 
by fair gender balance, ensuring balanced involvement of stakeholders from different stakeholder 
groups from COST Member Countries, Near Neighbouring Countries and International Partner 
Countries . Though the geographical spread of our Action network is very broad, our engagement plan 
will also aim to extend it to the remaining European countries.  
Researchers at universities and research institutes will be reached by established mechanisms such as 
papers in high impact, peer-reviewed international journals (open access journals), presentations at 
international conferences and workshops and &quot;white papers&quot; on best practice guidelines. Moreover, the 
Action intends to involve numerous Early Career Investigators (ECI) and provide them with networking 
and exchange opportunities. The goal is to facilitate the exchange of young researchers to give them 
access to senior researchers throughout the network, receive feedback on their research work, get 
involved in new cross-country projects and gain international visibility for their research. This will be 
done through a range of measures, including research visits and participation in conferences and 
workshops. 
A high inclusion of industry members, including Fintech companies and investors, business angels, 
target incubators, innovation hubs and fintech districts, sand boxes, will be achieved by actively using 
the full range of available networking tools (e.g., workshops, conferences, brainstorming sessions, joint 
research and R&amp;D projects, etc.) within the stakeholder engagement strategy.  
Major policy makers at the EU, national and local level will be provided with policy briefs (position 
papers) on the key outcomes of our Action and their possible implications for society. Additionally, they 
will be invited to attend the major conferences organized within the Action. The Action will also have 
dedicated workshops, combining academia, industry and national and European authorities. 
Our Action will also reach citizens and citizen science organizations through social media such as 
Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Moreover, numerous articles will be published in the press and 
scientific magazines.  
Involving stakeholders will be a top priority of the MC of this Action. Here below is an overview of the 
stakeholders&#x27; engagement by working group.

Last but not least, the Action seeks to achieve the optimal gender balance among participants with the 
aim that 50% of the core group members will be female.

2.2.3 
MUTUAL BENEFITS OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF SECONDARY PROPOSERS FROM NEAR 
NEIGHBOUR 
OR 
INTERNATIONAL 
PARTNER 
COUNTRIES 
OR 
INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANISATIONS 
The secondary proposers and partners from near-neighbouring and international countries are 
important due to two reasons. The first one is that the financial industry is global in nature due to the 
mobility of capital in the current historical context and, therefore, research must have a global 
perspective as well as a concern for local circumstances. The second one is that research communities 
and the financial industry represented by nodes of the network at different locations specialize, at least 
to some extent, on different topics, which are all essential to the success of the Action. For the same 
reasons, the Action will further expand its international reach on an ongoing basis, exploiting its open 
architecture to include further partners from outside Europe, especially but not exclusively near 
neighbour ones, and international organizations.

3.2 
MEASURES TO MAXIMISE IMPACT 
3.2.1 
KNOWLEDGE CREATION, TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT 
The Action will actively reach industrial stakeholders by implementing an extensive dissemination plan. 
In particular, the Action&#x27;s dissemination plan provides for regular meetings of Action&#x27;s participants with 
industry practitioners. Numerous companies from the fields of finance, legal, finance and technology 
have confirmed their participation in research and knowledge-sharing activities of the Action. They will 
be reached mainly through invitations to organized conferences, workshops and regular meetings with 
industry, where they will have an opportunity to present their companies’ profiles as direct participants 
of the Action. 
The Action will have a dedicated Stakeholder Coordinator, responsible for managing the stakeholder’s 
involvement. In collaboration with the Stakeholder Coordinator, the most appropriate MC members 
(considering the geographical location, institutional connections and field of work) will establish 
communication with members of selected stakeholders’ groups, inviting them to participate in the Action. 
Stakeholders will participate in international conferences, in particular in dedicated sessions for sharing 
expertise, identifying common challenges and requirements, and familiarizing stakeholders with early 
results of the Action. Stakeholders will cooperate and interact with each other in the Action via 
workshops, seminars and training schools. STSMs will be the means to connect different stakeholders. 
Through a regularly updated website and social profiles, as described below, a transparent and frequent 
dissemination of the Action’s activities will facilitate informing current and potential stakeholders.  
The Action will involve numerous Early Career Investigators (ECI) and provide them with networking 
and exchange opportunities through STSMs. Most participants supervise or co-operate with PhD 
candidates and post-doc researchers and the goal is to facilitate the exchange of young researchers 
including research stays abroad . 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 15"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
       11 
Within the first year of the start of the Action, a knowledge exchange and collaboration platform will be 
introduced, where the draft documents will be developed, and data and software will be shared.  
3.2.2 
PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND/OR EXPLOITATION AND DIALOGUE WITH THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC OR POLICY 
The Action will appoint a dedicated Science Communication Manager. She/he will be asked to create a 
detailed dissemination and exploitation plan, which will be regularly updated. The Action will create its 
own graphical identity and interactive, mobile-friendly website within the first nine months, which will be 
the front-end of a platform for informing the general public, policy makers, citizen science organizations 
and companies about current activities and planned future activities. This platform will be distinct from 
the knowledge exchange and collaboration platform (see just above, in section 3.2.1) but the two 
platforms will be able to securely interact. A contact form will be available on the web-site to obtain 
feedback from the public. A mailing list will also be formed to inform the interested parties about new 
publications on the website and invitations for supported events participation. 
FinAI will further increase its online presence by creating social network profiles to keep interested 
parties and the general public informed. ResearchGate, Twitter and LinkedIn will be initially targeted 
and after that, the presence will be increased on other social networks if needed. Representative 
materials such as posters, banners and others, will be created based on the graphical identity and will 
be provided to the participating institutions and partners to promote the Action.  
Meetings with regulators will be held on a regular basis, in order to receive early feedback on the 
usefulness and feasibility of the methods, results and deliverables prior to their public release, and 
ensure the acceptance of the project by the regulators. 
The Action will organize several workshops and conferences to present ongoing research activities and 
developments. Policy makers and industry practitioners will be invited to participate in the conferences 
and workshops and will be encouraged to give guest presentations and keynotes. For each event 
organized by the Action, the local media will be invited to cover the events and the local public will be 
informed about the Action goals, achievements and ongoing activities. 
The Action will organize at least four public panel discussions and invite experts and policy makers from 
public institutions and industry, as well as academia, where feedback from the public will be obtained 
and the objectives of the Action will be discussed. 
In addition to workshops, conferences and public panels, expert panel discussions will be organized 
with the purpose to summarize the findings, inputs and conclusions from all activities.  
Each working group of the Action will publish a yearly report that will be available on the website of the 
Action. At the end of the Action a final report will contain the conclusions from the work done within the 
activities of the Action and give recommendations for further developments.

COHERENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WORK PLAN 
4.1.1 
DESCRIPTION OF WORKING GROUPS, TASKS AND ACTIVITIES 
To accomplish the Action&#x27;s objectives, three working groups (WGs) will be formed. Close cooperation 
and exchange of knowledge between the WGs will be essential. All three WGs will have the common 
goal of creating an attractive and transparent forum to engage with stakeholders, facilitate knowledge 
and experience sharing and stimulate reflection on transparency-related issues in financial markets. The 
research objectives of each WP have been described in section 1.2.2.1. The main tasks and activities 
are described below.

High 
(1.1)  Tools to track research input of all partners  
(1.2)  Increase shared responsibility for every task 
(1.3)  Involve MC to find solutions to increase the contribution 
          of partners 
(2)     Redundant skills are available in the network,  
         substitute non- delivering partners 
Limited 
involvement of 
Action members 
Medium 
Low 
(1.1)  Equip the Action with enough members so that no  
          member is irreplaceable 
(1.2)  Use advanced research collaboration tools 
(2)     Elect and appoint new members for the under-covered  
         positions 
Lack of interest 
and involvement of 
regulatory bodies 
Medium 
Medium (1.1)  The importance of this Action is already acknowledged  
          by policy makers and regulators. 
(1.2)  Use the network to invite regulatory bodies from more  
          countries 
(1.3)  Increase focus on the regulatory applications of the  
          research output 
(1.4)  Organize dedicated knowledge-exchange sessions with 
          regulators and industry 
(2)     Formally invite regulators to Action events to increase 
          interest and involvement 
Gender imbalance Low 
Low 
(1.1)  Include female participants in core decisions and      
         organization; reserve certain core functions to female  
         participants  
(1.2)  Re-allocate funds to increase and support the  
         involvement of female researchers 
(2)    Organize events and summer schools that have female 
         researchers as target audience

involvement of  
European 
organisations 
Low 
High 
(1.1)  The MC will ensure the involvement of national  
         policymakers  
(1.2)  The Chair and Vice-Chair will have the responsibility to  
          inform and involve EU level organisations 
(2)     Formally invite European organisations to Action events
