3. Fostering Transparency in FinTech and AI for Finance  
The COST Action CA19130, titled “Fintech and Artificial Intelligence in Finance - Towards a 
Transparent Financial Industry” (FinAI), aims to enhance transparency in the financial sector 
through the integration of AI and FinTech. This initiative seeks to bridge the gap between 
academia, industry, public institutions, and governmental organizations across Europe. The 
financial industry is at the forefront of digital transformation, with FinTech (Financial Technology) 
and AI (Artificial Intelligence) playing a pivotal role in driving innovation and efficiency. While 
technologies like blockchain, peer-to-peer lending, and AI-based decision models have 
revolutionized financial services, their increased adoption has also raised significant concerns 
regarding transparency, regulatory oversight, and consumer protection. As a major contributor to 
economic growth and stability, the financial industry&#x27;s adoption of AI-supported services 
necessitates a heightened focus on transparency. Ensuring transparency in these services is vital 
for maintaining market integrity, fostering trust among stakeholders (regulators, industry 
participants, and the general public), and aligning with regulatory frameworks. The Action 
recognizes the potential of FinTech and AI to enhance efficiency and innovation but also 
acknowledges the concerns surrounding the use of opaque &quot;black-box&quot; decision-support models 
and the lack of clarity in performance reporting for investment products. By bringing together 
researchers, industry experts, policymakers, and stakeholders, FinAI aims to develop 
methodologies and best practices that promote transparency without compromising technological 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 13"></div><pre class="text-content">
13 
 
progress. Through its efforts, the Action seeks to scrutinize and make more transparent the AI 
models used in the financial industry, improve transparency in FinTech processes involving risk 
assessment and decision-making, and enhance the reporting of investment product performance. 
Ultimately, FinAI&#x27;s goal is to foster an environment where technological innovation and regulatory 
oversight can coexist, ensuring that financial services remain transparent, accountable, and aligned 
with the best interests of consumers and the broader economy. 
Risk awareness and consumer protection: Financial products and services can involve complex 
risks and uncertainties. Transparency allows market participants, including consumers, to 
understand the risks and opportunities associated with these products and services. In the FinTech 
space, where innovations such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies and AI models for credit scoring 
and risk assessment are evolving rapidly, transparent practices help mitigate potential risks by 
providing clear information about how these technologies work, how decisions are made and what 
factors which influence the results. This level of transparency can help prevent fraudulent activity 
and protect investors from undue risk. 
Regulatory compliance and oversight: Regulatory bodies play a vital role in ensuring that the 
financial industry operates in a fair, responsible and consumer-centric manner. Non-transparent, 
&quot;black box&quot; AI models and opaque decision-making processes pose significant challenges for 
regulatory bodies, as they can obscure how decisions are made and potentially lead to biased or 
incorrect outcomes. Transparency in financial services is essential for effective regulatory 
oversight, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations and maintaining public 
confidence in the financial system. 
Market integrity and trust: Lack of transparency can undermine market integrity and erode trust 
among stakeholders, including investors, financial institutions and the general public. Transparent 
practices promote trust in the financial system by providing stakeholders with clear information 
about how financial products, services and decision-making processes work. This transparency 
helps mitigate information asymmetries, reduces the potential for market manipulation and 
promotes fair competition within the industry. 
Accountability and ethical considerations: Transparency in finance and FinTech is crucial to 
ensure accountability and address ethical concerns. As AI-powered decision-making systems 
become more common, it is essential to ensure that these systems are transparent, explainable and 
aligned with ethical principles such as fairness, non-discrimination and privacy protection. 
Transparent practices allow stakeholders to critically analyze decision-making processes, identify 
potential biases or unintended consequences, and hold institutions accountable for their actions. 
Innovation and collaboration: Transparency can encourage innovation and collaboration in the 
finance and FinTech sectors. Through the open exchange of information and best practices, 
industry players can learn from each other, identify areas for improvement, and collaborate on 
developing new solutions that balance innovation with transparency and accountability. This 
collaborative approach can foster the responsible adoption of emerging technologies while 
addressing the challenges associated with their implementation.

Overall, transparency is critical to maintaining trust, promoting innovation, ensuring regulatory 
compliance and protecting the interests of consumers and stakeholders in the finance and FinTech 
sectors. By promoting transparency, COST Action CA19130 aims to create a financial industry 
that is not only technologically advanced, but also ethical, responsible and aligned with the 
principles of fairness and consumer protection. 
Background and Rationale 
The rapid advancement of financial technologies (FinTech) and artificial intelligence (AI) has 
revolutionized the financial sector, driving digital transformation and innovation. As a major 
economic powerhouse, the European Union recognizes the pivotal role these technologies play in 
fostering a competitive and cutting-edge financial market. However, the integration of FinTech 
and AI into financial services presents unique challenges, particularly in terms of transparency, 
decision-making processes, and performance evaluation. 
The COST Action CA19130 addresses these challenges by focusing on three key areas: 
1. Transparency in FinTech: The financial industry has embraced various FinTech solutions, 
ranging from mobile banking and digital payments to algorithmic trading and robo-
advisors. While these technologies offer enhanced efficiency and convenience, they often 
lack transparency, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand their underlying 
mechanisms and potential biases. This action aims to improve the clarity and openness of 
financial technologies, enabling better understanding and trust among consumers, 
regulators, and industry players. 
2. Decision-Support Models: The financial sector relies heavily on decision-support models, 
which range from transparent, interpretable models to opaque, black-box models powered 
by advanced machine learning algorithms. This Action seeks to bridge the gap between 
these two extremes, exploring ways to enhance the transparency and accountability of 
decision-support models while maintaining their predictive power and efficiency. 
3. Investment Product Performance: Investors and clients have a right to transparent and 
accurate information regarding the performance of investment products. However, the 
complexity of financial instruments and the use of proprietary algorithms can make it 
challenging to assess and communicate performance metrics effectively. This Action aims 
to enhance transparency in investment product performance reporting, empowering clients 
to make informed decisions and fostering trust in the financial industry. 
Through this Annual Report Initiative, the COST Action CA19130 seeks to facilitate knowledge 
exchange, foster collaboration, and promote transparency across the FinTech and AI domains 
within the financial sector. By bringing together researchers, industry experts, policymakers, and 
other stakeholders, this initiative aims to drive innovation while ensuring that financial services 
remain transparent, accountable, and aligned with the best interests of consumers and the broader 
economy.
