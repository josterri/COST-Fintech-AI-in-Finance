MoU objectives, Action deliverables and Grant Agreement Period Goals
Action Objectives from MoU
Aim/primary Objective
establish a large and interconnected community across academia, public institutions and industry focusing
on Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence, improving transparency in financial services, especially
in and through FinTech, in financial modelling and investment performance evaluation
Secondary objectives
1.To develop blended approaches to evaluate innovative financial services and their providers,
especially in the FinTech domain, building on Machine Learning methods, focussing on prediction
(early warning) of operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal behaviour ranging from appropriation
of loaned funds to money-laundering activities.
2.The development of conceptual and methodological tools for establishing when black-box models
are admissible and, to the extent possible, making them more transparent and/or replacing them
with interpretable and explainable models.
3.To receive input from regulators and practitioners&#x27; communities and to validate results with regard
to increasing transparency of artificial intelligence applications.
4.Pruning and improvement of the vast array of performance attribution models by contributing to the
development of methodologies for reducing the false discovery rate in financial research and
applied financial investment management.
5.Disseminate to the public and share with regulators the results on investment product performance
evaluation.
6.Creation of the first European platform comparing the out-of-sample performance of banks&#x27;
investment products, insurance-linked investment products and asset management products
available to the general public.
7.Create an excellent network of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the lifetime
of the Action.
8.Bringing technological, quantitative and economic researchers together, to tackle future research
that can only be done in an interdisciplinary setting, and getting actively involved in the blockchain
and FinTech communities across Europe, to constantly monitor developments, get input and
disseminate results.
9.Bridging the gap between practitioners from the finance industry, academics and regulators by
setting up a common knowledge exchange platform.
10.Transfer knowledge in terms of expertise, scientific tools and human resources across the different
disciplines and between academia and industry.
11.Establish an inclusive community of researchers on methodological and technological themes in
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, to promote Early Career Investigators and increase
their visibility.
12.Overcome the siloing of research topics by country and achieve geographical and demographical
diversity, with special attention to COST Inclusiveness Target countries.
13.Prepare competitive European researchers for a fruitful career in an international environment
through intensive use of Short Term Scientific Missions (STSM) and joint educational programs
with industrial partners.
14.Maximize the job opportunities for PhD students and Early Career Investigators.
15.Disseminate the results of the Action&#x27;s activities to the scientific community, European institutions
and to the general public.
16.Significantly improve the gender equality in the fields of the Action.
