MoU objectives, Action deliverables and Grant Agreement Period Goals
Action Objectives from MoU
Aim/primary Objective
establish a large and interconnected community across academia, public institutions and industry focusing
on Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence, improving transparency in financial services, especially
in and through FinTech, in financial modelling and investment performance evaluation
Secondary objectives
1.To develop blended approaches to evaluate innovative financial services and their providers,
especially in the FinTech domain, building on Machine Learning methods, focussing on prediction
(early warning) of operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal behaviour ranging from appropriation
of loaned funds to money-laundering activities.
2.The development of conceptual and methodological tools for establishing when black-box models
are admissible and, to the extent possible, making them more transparent and/or replacing them
with interpretable and explainable models.
3.To receive input from regulators and practitioners&#x27; communities and to validate results with regard
to increasing transparency of artificial intelligence applications.
4.Pruning and improvement of the vast array of performance attribution models by contributing to the
development of methodologies for reducing the false discovery rate in financial research and
applied financial investment management.
5.Disseminate to the public and share with regulators the results on investment product performance
evaluation.
6.Creation of the first European platform comparing the out-of-sample performance of banks&#x27;
investment products, insurance-linked investment products and asset management products
available to the general public.
7.Create an excellent network of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the lifetime
of the Action.
8.Bringing technological, quantitative and economic researchers together, to tackle future research
that can only be done in an interdisciplinary setting, and getting actively involved in the blockchain
and FinTech communities across Europe, to constantly monitor developments, get input and
disseminate results.
9.Bridging the gap between practitioners from the finance industry, academics and regulators by
setting up a common knowledge exchange platform.
10.Transfer knowledge in terms of expertise, scientific tools and human resources across the different
disciplines and between academia and industry.
11.Establish an inclusive community of researchers on methodological and technological themes in
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, to promote Early Career Investigators and increase
their visibility.
12.Overcome the siloing of research topics by country and achieve geographical and demographical
diversity, with special attention to COST Inclusiveness Target countries.
13.Prepare competitive European researchers for a fruitful career in an international environment
through intensive use of Short Term Scientific Missions (STSM) and joint educational programs
with industrial partners.
14.Maximize the job opportunities for PhD students and Early Career Investigators.
15.Disseminate the results of the Action&#x27;s activities to the scientific community, European institutions
and to the general public.
16.Significantly improve the gender equality in the fields of the Action.

Description
https://www.meetup.com/Fintech_AI_in_Finance/events/283173624/ The co-
organised conference “ML approaches Finance and Management” will be a two-
day hybrid event. It provides a platform for interdisciplinary discussion on AI
application in finance, interpretable ML in management, statistics and
explainable AI, blended approaches in the FinTech domain, which is highly
related to the COST Action FinAI. The conference will be recorded. The slides
will be available to all COST members. Moreover, the event is organised by
female researchers, and female scientists will also present on the conference
(meet GP2 the goal 6, Capacity Building 10). The conference will be recorded
by video. (meet GP2 the goal 8). Keynote speakers include Prof. Giuseppe
Cavaliere (University of Bologna), Prof. Francis de Véricourt (ESMT Berlin),
Prof. Wolfgang Karl Härdle (Humboldt University of Berlin), Prof. Dennis
Kristensen (University College London) Prof. Olivier Scaillet (University of
Geneva), Prof. Dacheng Xiu (University of Chicago). They will provide valuable
insight on the topic from multiple perspectives. It will help to create an excellent
network of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the lifetime
of the Action. (meet Capacity Building 1-9) There will be a dedicated COST
FinAI Session: It will be from 14.45 to 17:45 on March 24th (3hours). Four
speakers will present here. Every presentation will last 45 minutes. Prof. Dr.
Wolfgang Härdle and I (1.75 hours) and Rui Ren are also from COST FinAI. So
In total we have at least six speakers from COST FinAI, and total time is 4.75
hours. On March 25, 2022, we are also planning a working group meeting of
working group 1 after the end of the co-organised conference. Travel cost
reimbursement is restricted to COST FinAI members. The allocated budget
cannot be exceeded. In case of budget restrictions, preference for
reimbursement will be given to COST FinAI members based on their
contributions to the Action, to this particular event as well as the contribution to
goals and objectives that have not yet been achieved, taking also diversity
considerations and previous budget allocations into account. LOS is 50% of the
maximum eligible amount and will be reduced accordingly in case of a lower
number of participants and conditional on the COST FinAI session.
Output(s)
A section will be designated for COST, which will be beneficial for the
dissemination of the Action results • Video of the conference. • Slides available
for all COST members • Codes available on the Quantlets. • Excellent network
of researchers in Europe • Exchange of knowledges and further collaboration
We will meet the following objectives: • AI application in finance (meet GP2 the
goal 2 and 10, Capacity Building 2, 5-9) • ML in management (meet Capacity

Output(s)
1. Re Codified knowledge: methods and models that can be used in the
FinTech industry, in particular in NFT and cryptocurrency markets. 2. Re tacit
knowledge: know-how regarding ways of evaluation of innovative financial
services related to NFTs and cryptocurrencies as well as beliefs and
recommendations for their further development 3. Re technology: empirical
models and approaches to evaluate and analyze NFTs and cryptocurrencies 4.
Re societal application: NFT potential is enormous, given that they can be used
to transfer rights related to both virtual and physical property. Thus, we expect
increased interest in and application of NFTs in the way how they can be
treated, held and valued from traditional institutions like museums, funds etc. as
well as in different applications, like selectively sharing pieces of our personal
identity or leveraging NFTs as access tokens. Also, we can expect to see
broader adoption of blockchain technologies, to digitise, track and monitor
many more processes starting with medical data usage, ESG attributes,
verifying suppliers’ identities, money transfer

Description
Core group and WG3 meeting, co-located with EURO 2022. Daily allowance
and reimbursement only applies to the core group and WG3 meeting. This will
take place during the EURO 2022 conference, which is organized by a COST
FinAI member and lasts several days. Due to the variety of topics there, we will
schedule our meetings during a time, when no relevant COST FinAI topics are
discussed at the conference. Also, Peter Schwendner is organizing a dedicated
COST FinAI session at EURO 2022.

https://www.meetup.com/Fintech_AI_in_Finance/events/283344628/ COST
FinAI Core Group Meeting We aim to have two research talks specifically from
within our COST FinAI Action. Another focus is on COST FinAI science
communication. We will extend our strategic plan on how to disseminate our
research results. Working group meeting: · The networking activity will bring
together the WG3 members and serve the MoU objectives by facilitating
research presentations and discussions. One focus will be on the design of
stress tests for the evaluation of AI and ML models under dynamic financial
conditions to improve the robustness of investment strategies. Time permitting,
we will also discuss how to design AI models to generate “failed trials” of
investment product producers and on quantitative strategies. · The output will
be both codified knowledge (in the form of technical papers and publications) as
well as tacit knowledge. · There will be a 2h plenary session together with
several research presentations embedded in the “Area Financial modeling and
Risk management”. · Website for the co-located event: https://www.euro-
online.org/conf/euro32/streams · Within the “Area Financial modeling and Risk
management”, MC member Peter Schwendner will act as Chair of the session
“AI &amp; Innovation in Sustainable Finance”. · The COST Action will benefit from
the co-location by facilitating the interaction of its members with experts from
other sessions and areas, such as “Stochastic and Robust Optimization” or
“New challenges for financial modelling”. Travel cost reimbursement is
restricted to COST FinAI members. The allocated budget cannot be exceeded.
In case of budget restrictions, preference for reimbursement will be given to
COST FinAI members based on their contributions to the Action, to this
particular event as well as the contribution to goals and objectives that have not
yet been achieved, taking also diversity considerations and previous budget
allocations into account. LOS is 50% of the maximum eligible amount and will
be reduced accordingly in case of a lower number of participants.
Output(s)
We intend to find further concepts for our research, put in place a research
framework, and work on the development of joint proposals. We will discuss
and develop strategies to engage stakeholders in the Action, as well as work on
a discussion paper for possible approaches to building a statistically valid back-
testing framework. One focus will be on the design of stress tests for the
evaluation of AI and ML models under dynamic financial conditions to improve
the robustness of investment strategies. Time permitting, we will also discuss
how to design AI models to generate “failed trials” of investment product
producers and on quantitative strategies. The core group will meet to review the
COST FinAI Action so far and the plans going forward. This will serve as an
input to the annual MC meeting which will then take place in October. The
output will be an overview of the research results that have been achieved so
far in working groups 1,23, as well as an overview of the COST FinAI
achievements to date, for both research and diversity achievements. The output
will be summarized on the COST FInAI blog as well as a the COST FinAI
newsletter. Travel cost reimbursement is restricted to COST FinAI members
that contribute to the output described above.

Description
A Short-Term Scientific Mission consists of a visit of a host organization located
in a different country other than the country of affiliation by a Researcher or
Innovator for the specific work to be carried out and for a determined period of
time (COST-094-21). STSM Grant provides a contribution for travelling,
accommodation and subsistence expenses, implementation of the project,
delivery of the report to the COST Action MC and overall effort. The main
evaluation criteria include the following: (i) diversity, i.e., young researchers,
applicants and hosts form ITC countries, gender diversity; (ii) sound working
plan measured by scientific quality, potential impact, originality, benefits for the
Action; and (iii) compliance with the Grant Period’s goals and the overall
objectives (iv) Clear preference will be given to STSMs that can contribute to
goals and objectives that have not yet been fully achieved. A tangible output and
contribution need to be ensured. Preference will be given to existing COST FinAI
members. Each STSM grantee is expected to become a working group member
of the Action and continue to be involved. The budget for STSMs may be used
also to cover Virtual Networking Grants if becoming available through COST and
if deemed suitable for the Action.
Output(s)
The quantitative output includes successful applications from at least 6 different
host countries. The main research focus spins around the main current research
goals both of the CA 19130 and of the working groups, with a particular
emphasis on innovative financial services, especially in the FinTech domain and
its fairness and sustainability. Development of Machine Learning methods and
conceptual and methodological approaches to increase transparency of black-
box tools and, in a broad sense, of investment processes that use them is also
among the research priorities, We also aim at reducing the false discovery rate
in financial research and applied financial investment management. Grant
payment for each STSM grantee is conditional on generating at least the
following output: • give at least one talk, scheduled on the COST FinAI meet up •

Description
We will use ITC conference grants to explicitly enable ITC researchers to
participate in research conferences. The main evaluation criteria include the
following: (i) diversity, i.e., young researchers, applicants and hosts from ITC
countries, gender diversity; (ii) conference related to COST FinAI goals and
objectives (iii) compliance with the Grant Period’s goals and the overall
objectives (iv) Clear preference will be given to ITC grants that have the potential
to contribute to goals and objectives that have not yet been fully achieved. A
tangible output and contribution need to be ensured. Preference will be given to
existing COST FinAI members. Each ITC conference grantee is expected to
become a working group member of the Action and continue to be involved. The
budget for ITC Conference Grants may be used also to cover Dissemination
Grants, if deemed suitable for the Action.
Output(s)
The quantitative output includes successful applications from at least 3 different
countries. Grant payment for each ITC conference grantee is conditional on
generating at least the following output: • give at least one talk, scheduled on the
COST FinAI meet up • Write a one-page summary to be published on the
