MoU objectives, Action deliverables and Grant Agreement Period Goals
Action Objectives from MoU
Aim/primary Objective
establish a large and interconnected community across academia, public institutions and industry focusing
on Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence, improving transparency in financial services, especially
in and through FinTech, in financial modelling and investment performance evaluation
Secondary objectives
1.To develop blended approaches to evaluate innovative financial services and their providers,
especially in the FinTech domain, building on Machine Learning methods, focussing on prediction
(early warning) of operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal behaviour ranging from appropriation
of loaned funds to money-laundering activities.
2.The development of conceptual and methodological tools for establishing when black-box models
are admissible and, to the extent possible, making them more transparent and/or replacing them
with interpretable and explainable models.
3.To receive input from regulators and practitioners&#x27; communities and to validate results with regard
to increasing transparency of artificial intelligence applications.
4.Pruning and improvement of the vast array of performance attribution models by contributing to the
development of methodologies for reducing the false discovery rate in financial research and
applied financial investment management.
5.Disseminate to the public and share with regulators the results on investment product performance
evaluation.
6.Creation of the first European platform comparing the out-of-sample performance of banks&#x27;
investment products, insurance-linked investment products and asset management products
available to the general public.
7.Create an excellent network of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the lifetime
of the Action.
8.Bringing technological, quantitative and economic researchers together, to tackle future research
that can only be done in an interdisciplinary setting, and getting actively involved in the blockchain
and FinTech communities across Europe, to constantly monitor developments, get input and
disseminate results.
9.Bridging the gap between practitioners from the finance industry, academics and regulators by
setting up a common knowledge exchange platform.
10.Transfer knowledge in terms of expertise, scientific tools and human resources across the different
disciplines and between academia and industry.
11.Establish an inclusive community of researchers on methodological and technological themes in
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, to promote Early Career Investigators and increase
their visibility.
12.Overcome the siloing of research topics by country and achieve geographical and demographical
diversity, with special attention to COST Inclusiveness Target countries.
13.Prepare competitive European researchers for a fruitful career in an international environment
through intensive use of Short Term Scientific Missions (STSM) and joint educational programs
with industrial partners.
14.Maximize the job opportunities for PhD students and Early Career Investigators.
15.Disseminate the results of the Action&#x27;s activities to the scientific community, European institutions
and to the general public.
16.Significantly improve the gender equality in the fields of the Action.

take place during the EURO 2022 conference, which is organized by a COST
FinAI member and lasts several days. Due to the variety of topics there, we will
schedule our meetings during a time, when no relevant COST FinAI topics are

Output(s)
We intend to find further concepts for our research, put in place a research
framework, and work on the development of joint proposals. We will discuss
and develop strategies to engage stakeholders in the Action, as well as work on
a discussion paper for possible approaches to building a statistically valid back-
testing framework. One focus will be on the design of stress tests for the
evaluation of AI and ML models under dynamic financial conditions to improve
the robustness of investment strategies. Time permitting, we will also discuss
how to design AI models to generate “failed trials” of investment product
producers and on quantitative strategies. The core group will meet to review the
COST FinAI Action so far and the plans going forward. This will serve as an
input to the annual MC meeting which will then take place in October. The
output will be an overview of the research results that have been achieved so
far in working groups 1,23, as well as an overview of the COST FinAI
achievements to date, for both research and diversity achievements. The output
will be summarized on the COST FInAI blog as well as a the COST FinAI
newsletter. Travel cost reimbursement is restricted to COST FinAI members
that contribute to the output described above.

Description
A Short-Term Scientific Mission consists of a visit of a host organization located
in a different country other than the country of affiliation by a Researcher or
Innovator for the specific work to be carried out and for a determined period of
time (COST-094-21). STSM Grant provides a contribution for travelling,
accommodation and subsistence expenses, implementation of the project,
delivery of the report to the COST Action MC and overall effort. The main
evaluation criteria include the following: (i) diversity, i.e., young researchers,
applicants and hosts form ITC countries, gender diversity; (ii) sound working
plan measured by scientific quality, potential impact, originality, benefits for the
Action; and (iii) compliance with the Grant Period’s goals and the overall
objectives (iv) Clear preference will be given to STSMs that can contribute to
goals and objectives that have not yet been fully achieved. A tangible output and
contribution need to be ensured. Preference will be given to existing COST FinAI
members. Each STSM grantee is expected to become a working group member
of the Action and continue to be involved. The budget for STSMs may be used
also to cover Virtual Networking Grants if becoming available through COST and
if deemed suitable for the Action.
Output(s)
The quantitative output includes successful applications from at least 6 different
host countries. The main research focus spins around the main current research
goals both of the CA 19130 and of the working groups, with a particular
emphasis on innovative financial services, especially in the FinTech domain and
its fairness and sustainability. Development of Machine Learning methods and
conceptual and methodological approaches to increase transparency of
blackbox tools and, in a broad sense, of investment processes that use them is
also among the research priorities, We also aim at reducing the false discovery
rate in financial research and applied financial investment management. Grant
payment for each STSM grantee is conditional on generating at least the
following output: • give at least one talk, scheduled on the COST FinAI meet up •

Description
We will use ITC conference grants to explicitly enable ITC researchers to
participate in research conferences. The main evaluation criteria include the
following: (i) diversity, i.e., young researchers, applicants and hosts from ITC
countries, gender diversity; (ii) conference related to COST FinAI goals and
objectives (iii) compliance with the Grant Period’s goals and the overall
objectives (iv) Clear preference will be given to ITC grants that have the potential
to contribute to goals and objectives that have not yet been fully achieved. A
tangible output and contribution need to be ensured. Preference will be given to
existing COST FinAI members. Each ITC conference grantee is expected to
become a working group member of the Action and continue to be involved. The
budget for ITC Conference Grants may be used also to cover Dissemination
Grants, if deemed suitable for the Action.
Output(s)
The quantitative output includes successful applications from at least 3 different
countries. Grant payment for each ITC conference grantee is conditional on
generating at least the following output: • give at least one talk, scheduled on the
COST FinAI meet up • Write a one-page summary to be published on the
webpage
