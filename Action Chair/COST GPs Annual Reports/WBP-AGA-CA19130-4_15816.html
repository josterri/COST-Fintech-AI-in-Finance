MoU objectives, Action deliverables and Grant Agreement Period Goals
Action Objectives from MoU
Aim/primary Objective
establish a large and interconnected community across academia, public institutions and industry focusing on
Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence, improving transparency in financial services, especially in
and through FinTech, in financial modelling and investment performance evaluation
Secondary objectives
1. To develop blended approaches to evaluate innovative financial services and their providers,
especially in the FinTech domain, building on Machine Learning methods, focussing on prediction
(early warning) of operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal behaviour ranging from appropriation of
loaned funds to money-laundering activities.
2. The development of conceptual and methodological tools for establishing when black-box models are
admissible and, to the extent possible, making them more transparent and/or replacing them with
interpretable and explainable models.
3. To receive input from regulators and practitioners&#x27; communities and to validate results with regard to
increasing transparency of artificial intelligence applications.
4. Pruning and improvement of the vast array of performance attribution models by contributing to the
development of methodologies for reducing the false discovery rate in financial research and applied
financial investment management.
5. Disseminate to the public and share with regulators the results on investment product performance
evaluation.
6. Creation of the first European platform comparing the out-of-sample performance of banks&#x27;
investment products, insurance-linked investment products and asset management products available
to the general public.
7. Create an excellent network of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the lifetime of
the Action.
8. Bringing technological, quantitative and economic researchers together, to tackle future research that
can only be done in an interdisciplinary setting, and getting actively involved in the blockchain and
FinTech communities across Europe, to constantly monitor developments, get input and disseminate
results.
9. Bridging the gap between practitioners from the finance industry, academics and regulators by setting
up a common knowledge exchange platform.
10. Transfer knowledge in terms of expertise, scientific tools and human resources across the different
disciplines and between academia and industry.
11. Establish an inclusive community of researchers on methodological and technological themes in
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, to promote Early Career Investigators and increase their
visibility.
12. Overcome the siloing of research topics by country and achieve geographical and demographical
diversity, with special attention to COST Inclusiveness Target countries.
13. Prepare competitive European researchers for a fruitful career in an international environment through
intensive use of Short Term Scientific Missions (STSM) and joint educational programs with industrial
partners.
14. Maximize the job opportunities for PhD students and Early Career Investigators.
15. Disseminate the results of the Action&#x27;s activities to the scientific community, European institutions and
to the general public.
16. Significantly improve the gender equality in the fields of the Action.

Description
As this will be the first in person meeting of the Action in 2023, during the Core
Group meeting (approx. 2 hours) the status of the Action will be assessed,
especially in terms of the objectives and deliverables - what was achieved in GP2
and what is running or has to be achieved in GP3. The Diversity Team will meet
after, to assess the diversity report for GP2 and prepare the strategy for GP3,
especially to prepare the Women in Fintech III Conference in May 2023, in
Coimbra, Portugal. Additionally, a special paper session will be dedicated to
presentation of research conducted by the diversity team. WG1 and WG2 will meet
in parallel on the 2nd day, to discuss research conducted in each of them, on one
hand, and their strategies related to objectives and deliverables, on the other. This
meeting is also related to the Action’s Strategy to engage stakeholders - related to
this, the status of the strategy’s fulfilment will be assessed and actions to enhance
cooperation with the stakeholders will be discussed. For this, the meeting will end
with a round table with the representatives of the Romanian FinTech sector and
the IT companies working in the field. One of the meeting’s goals is to build the
action plan for the construction of the first FinTech report for the Balkans, once
again related to the Action’s strategy to engage stakeholders. Additionally, a
special session dedicated to PhD students and young researchers will be
organized. https://www.meetup.com/fintech_ai_in_finance/events/289867639/?

Description
This Training School will highlight to young researchers but also to others
interested in the topic, the challenges of Fintech and Artificial Intelligence in
Finance and will discuss the latest findings on how to improve it, with a special
focus on extending this towards Digital Finance. The trainers will be mainly
selected from the Action, across all working groups. Additional expertise will be
invited to discuss the future of Finance, related to Digital Finance. Using the MoU
of this Action as a hands-on example, trainees will learn to understand both
challenges and solutions in this field, to learn most recent AI techniques and their
short-comings as well as recent applications. Financial support will be provided to
PhD students, with priority to improve gender balance and for students from ITC
countries. Established researchers will have to use their own travel funds,
especially from non-ITC countries. Hybrid; 5 days, each day 3 hours in the
morning and 3 hours in the afternoon Monday morning, Tuesday Afternoon,
Wednesday morning, Thursday afternoon: PhD sessions Monday afternoon:
Invited guest lectures Wednesday afternoon: Social event Tuesday morning,
Thursday morning: Mini-workshop Friday morning: Summary, feedback, wrap-up
Support, taking COST FinAI contributions into account, will be prioritised: 1) young
researchers from ITC 2) ITC 3) young researchers non-ITC. Senior researchers
from non-ITC are expected to use their own travel funds.
Output(s)
The event brings together member of the cost action and also contributes to the
following MoU objectives: by including participants from different areas and
disciplines, and involve possibly new members currently outside the CA19130
network, by organising a session dedicated to ECI and PhD students to receive
feedback by discussants and the audience, Geographical, age and gender
balance will be taken into account when accepting PhD students. A position paper
and roadmap on mitigating risks connected with the increased use of digital
assets A dedicated website will make the presentations and results available.
Substantial transfer of knowledge from experienced researchers to PhD students
(and vice versa). We expect a long-lasting effect on social interactions from this
kind of event. Improved understanding of academic state-of-the art in AI for
Finance, training slides, presentation slides and new research challenges for ML
in Finance developed by participants available on the Action website. Deliverable
11 for GP3 will be done after the event.

Description
The Training School in Advanced Statistical Modelling for Fintech, financial
inclusion and inequality is offered by University of Naples Federico II and is hosted
by the Laboratory for Statistical Data Analysis within the Department of Political
Science, University of Naples Federico II in September 2023 (13, 14, 15). The
School is designed for COST members, stakeholders, researchers, PhD students,
and possibly brilliant MSc graduates / final-year students interested in Statistics,
Probability, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and related areas.The
trainers have been selected from the Action, across all working groups. Among
participants the school will aim at a 50% gender representation and include
members from at least 5 different countries, including ITC members. Preliminary
availability by Albania, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Romania, Turkey,
Macedonia. The aim of the Training School (TS) AFFINE is to establish a track of
high level courses on advanced and cutting-edge topics in Statistics and
Probability with application in FinTech and Artificial Intelligence area. Expertise
and regulators will be invited to discuss the future of Finance, related to Digital
Finance. Participants will learn to understand both the challenges and solutions in
this field, learn about numeracy related to the latest AI techniques, as well as the
latest applications. The School offers lectures delivered by internationally leading
scholars, selected from the Action, across all working groups, on the specific
designated topic, and supervised tutorials. During the school participants analyse
the results of a survey on ‘Knowledge and use of Fintech products’ administered
as part of the CA19130 Action from September to December 2022 and discuss
them also with end-user organisations. One of the objectives is to analyse data
and assess the presence of diversity and inclusion in the fintech area through
appropriate statistical models. Financial support will be provided to PhD and MSc
graduates / final-year students, with priority to improve gender balance and for
students from ITC countries. Established researchers with their own travel funds
can join the Training School without reimbursement by the Action. Training school
for researchers, PhDs and Master students. We will invite trainers and
participants. 3 workshops delivered by internationally leading scholars (3h each)
on a dedicated topic with implementations in our COST Action area will be given.
Two Lab sessions (3h each) show how to repeat the results presented in the
theoretical sessions through the use of open source software. One afternoon is
dedicated to special training on transferable skills. One afternoon for social
networking. A welcome event with a poster session where participants may show
their research activity will also be provided. The event allows an exchange of
information on activities even by those who are not currently part of the action.
Last day is also dedicated to receive input from regulators (Bank of Italy) and
practitioners&#x27; communities and to validate results with regard to increasing
transparency of artificial intelligence and Fintech applications (obj 3; 15 - overall
objectives). All payment is conditional on trainers to come from at least 5 different
COST countries, that contribute at least 60%, with each country at most 20%.
Travel reimbursement is restricted to COST members with significant contributions
to the meeting or the Action.

Output(s)
To introduce participants to statistical models for analysing complex data
structures from large-scale surveys consisting of multiple-choice items. Present
parametric and non-parametric frameworks, joint methods for dimension reduction
and clustering, statistical learning for fintech data science, data integration, data
pre-processing and data fusion enhancing participants&#x27; understanding. A
discussion paper for possible approaches to building a statistically valid back-
testing framework is one of the deliverables (see point 5 GP3 - Overall
deliverables). Methodological discussion papers on AI models to generate “failed
trials” of investment product producers and on quantitative strategies with the
usage of the promising field of network data analysis exchanges and regional
consolidation platforms optimised for accessibility to all partners represent another
AFFINE deliverable (see point 10 GP3 - Overall deliverables). Course slides and
new solutions from open-source software packages, also developed by
participants, will be available on the Action website. Key software (codes,
packages) in line with WG objectives will be developed (see point 12 GP3 -
Overall deliverables). The COST FinAI website will make the presentations and
results available. Substantial transfer of knowledge from experienced researchers
to PhD/master students (and vice versa). We expect a long-lasting effect on social
interactions from this kind of event. Improved understanding of academic state-of-
the art in AI for Finance, training slides, presentation slides and new research
challenges for ML in Finance developed by participants available on the Action
