MoU objectives, Action deliverables and Grant Agreement Period Goals
Action Objectives from MoU
Aim/primary Objective
establish a large and interconnected community across academia, public institutions and industry focusing on
Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence, improving transparency in financial services, especially in
and through FinTech, in financial modelling and investment performance evaluation
Secondary objectives
1. To develop blended approaches to evaluate innovative financial services and their providers,
especially in the FinTech domain, building on Machine Learning methods, focussing on prediction
(early warning) of operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal behaviour ranging from appropriation of
loaned funds to money-laundering activities.
2. The development of conceptual and methodological tools for establishing when black-box models are
admissible and, to the extent possible, making them more transparent and/or replacing them with
interpretable and explainable models.
3. To receive input from regulators and practitioners&#x27; communities and to validate results with regard to
increasing transparency of artificial intelligence applications.
4. Pruning and improvement of the vast array of performance attribution models by contributing to the
development of methodologies for reducing the false discovery rate in financial research and applied
financial investment management.
5. Disseminate to the public and share with regulators the results on investment product performance
evaluation.
6. Creation of the first European platform comparing the out-of-sample performance of banks&#x27;
investment products, insurance-linked investment products and asset management products available
to the general public.
7. Create an excellent network of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the lifetime of
the Action.
8. Bringing technological, quantitative and economic researchers together, to tackle future research that
can only be done in an interdisciplinary setting, and getting actively involved in the blockchain and
FinTech communities across Europe, to constantly monitor developments, get input and disseminate
results.
9. Bridging the gap between practitioners from the finance industry, academics and regulators by setting
up a common knowledge exchange platform.
10. Transfer knowledge in terms of expertise, scientific tools and human resources across the different
disciplines and between academia and industry.
11. Establish an inclusive community of researchers on methodological and technological themes in
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, to promote Early Career Investigators and increase their
visibility.
12. Overcome the siloing of research topics by country and achieve geographical and demographical
diversity, with special attention to COST Inclusiveness Target countries.
13. Prepare competitive European researchers for a fruitful career in an international environment through
intensive use of Short Term Scientific Missions (STSM) and joint educational programs with industrial
partners.
14. Maximize the job opportunities for PhD students and Early Career Investigators.
15. Disseminate the results of the Action&#x27;s activities to the scientific community, European institutions and
to the general public.
16. Significantly improve the gender equality in the fields of the Action.

Description
Our Action has worked very hard over the last 3.5 years to address all
deliverables 1 to 15. We are very close to finish them all and only one more two-
day event is needed, where the core contributors work together. In particular,
Deliverable 15 requires an in-person meeting to do the final editing and final
decisions on what to include in our edited volume containing scientific
achievements of the Action. The agenda is as follows: - July 30 Morning: We will
choose the 10 most important outputs (not yet published) based on our COST
FinAI google scholar profile, and combine them. In this session, we have to write
the overall summary, the foreword and the conclusion, to have a comprehensive
scientific volume. This finishes deliverable 15: An edited volume containing
scientific achievements of the Action. - July 30 Afternoon: Deliverable 1, Strategy
to engage stakeholders in the Action (including revisions in month 24 and 36), is
already finished, but to really benefit from it, we now have to plan how this can
survive the end of the Action and come up with a long-term stakeholder strategy,
and adapt it. This will be achieved in this afternoon workshop. - July 31 Morning:
Deliverable 14, Key software (codes, packages) developed by each of the
Working Groups in line with their objectives, will also be finished. However, to
make it a coherent COST Action deliverable, we need to combine it, structure it
and have an overall description, conclusion and &quot;how-to&quot; for those software
packages of each individual working group. - July 31 Afternoon: For all
deliverables, we will write an overall wiki entry and short document, that describe
them individually, but most importantly, combine them to give one coherent output
for our Action. Meetup link:

Description
The Bifröst event aims to review our COST Action&#x27;s progress and plan ahead for
sustainability and greater impact. This two-day COST Meeting will focus on
strategizing scientific goals for the period after the COST Action and discuss long-
term plans. It will feature the discussion of signing of Erasmus agreements among
the 10 participating universities. Insights from the European Consortium for
Mathematics in Industry and industry leaders like ING, Deutsche Boerse, ICB, and
BIS will guide us in applying our research practically. The agenda is as follows:
How to proceed (Day 1 Morning): A dedicated session for discussing the signing
of bilateral Erasmus agreements between about 10 universities of our COST
Action, followed by a workshop led by a representative from the European
Consortium for Mathematics in Industry (ECMI), who has successfully been
running a previous COST Action and managed to extend this network beyond the
lifetime of the Action. The workshop will provide insights into building and
sustaining successful consortia, drawing on ECMIs 25 years of experience. Future
Industry collaborations (Day 1 Afternoon): Interactive discussions with industry
representatives from ING, Deutsche Boerse, ECB, and BIS. Those industry
partners are interested in our Action, the output and research. We will discuss on
how to continue our network, cooperating with industry and implement our
research results. Review of the Action (Day 2 Morning): Opening remarks and a

Description: We will provide one or two virtual grants per unfinished deliverable so that they can be used to
achieve deliverables that are not finished yet. Also, the payment is conditional on successfully
implementing the grant, in this case additionally (in addition to all COST rules on virtual grants)
defined as fully completing the deliverable by the end of the grant, in very good quality. STSMs
are offered for in-depth cooperations, exclusively to provide the means to achieve an unfinished
deliverable. We also make the payment conditional on fully completing the deliverable by the end
of the STSM in high quality. Preference will be given to young researchers, taking diversity into
account. Preference is also given to researchers that have contributed to the COST Action as
proven by COST acknowledgements and DOIs. It is understood that we will reevaluate the
amount of the grants in our next MC meetings potentially in favour of another meeting instead.
Objective: To advance the careers and skills of researchers by promoting collaboration,
knowledge transfer, and exposure to leading institutions within the FinAI COST Action network.
Mission: 1. Prioritize young researchers from ITCs to receive hands-on training and experiences
in at host institutions (ensuring gender balance). 2. Stimulate the exchange of innovative
practices, tools, and methodologies that address challenges specific to the FinAI cost network. 3.
Continue developing robust collaborative networks between young researchers and experienced
professionals. 4. Continue encouraging joint research endeavors and publications, with young
researchers from ITCs taking lead roles, focusing on the FinAI deliverables.
