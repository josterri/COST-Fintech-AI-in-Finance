• 
COST shall ensure the researchers and innovators participating in COST activities have the best 
experience possible and are enabled to maximise the scientific and innovation benefit of the 
activity.  
• 
COST shall therefore adopt a set of stable, minimal, and user-friendly rules to ensure efficient, 
effective, and impactful implementation of its activities: 
Adopts the present Rules and Principles for COST activities, which shall apply to COST Members, COST 
Governance, COST Scientific Committee, COST Administration and to participants to COST activities.  
The present Rules and Principles for COST activities shall lay down the principles and general rules for 
COST activities and govern:

1. SCOPE OF COST ACTIVITIES 
COST activities aim at implementing the COST mission and COST strategic priorities in line with COST 
positioning in the European Research Area.  
Therefore, the COST activities shall consist in:  
• 
COST Actions, 
• 
COST Innovators Grants, 
• 
Other COST centrally managed activities such as but not limited to COST Connect, COST 
Academy, External Communication and Cross-cutting activities, 
• 
Pilot projects.   
All COST activities shall be properly selected, implemented, closely monitored, and appropriately 
assessed to ensure a proper execution and suitable communication, dissemination, and valorisation of 
their results.  
2. SCOPE AND HIERARCHY OF RULES 
In addition to the principles and framework conditions laid down in the present Rules and Principles for 
COST activities (level A), the COST activities shall be governed by specific rules, hereinafter referred 
to as level B rules, that shall further define and govern the functioning and management of each of the 
COST activities.  
The level B rules shall include: 
• 
Rules on the submission, evaluation, selection and approval of proposals (SESA) for COST 
Actions;  
• 
COST Actions Rules;  
• 
COST Innovators Grant Rules; 
• 
Rules applicable to centrally managed activities; 
• 
Other specific rules for pilot projects. 
The Executive Board (EB) of the COST Association may further adopt Annotated Rules, hereinafter 
referred to as level C rules, aiming at providing practical handbooks in support of the applicable level B 
rules.  
Altogether, level A, B and C rules shall be referred to as the COST Implementation Rules. 
Level B and C rules shall not contravene the present Rules and Principles for COST activities, nor shall 
the level C rules contravene the applicable level B rules. In case of any contradiction, the present Rules 
and Principles for COST activities shall prevail. In case of contradiction between level C and applicable 
level B rules, the applicable level B rules shall prevail.  
In exceptional circumstances, duly justified in the superior interest of COST, the CSO may adopt 
specific provisions deviating from the present rules. 
3. PRINCIPLES GOVERNING COST ACTIVITIES 
COST activities shall be governed by principles, hereinafter referred to as COST Principles, that shall 
be the cornerstone of the rules applicable to COST activities as further defined in levels B and C rules 
and shall guide their set-up, implementation, and interpretation. 
COST Principles shall be applicable throughout the whole spectrum of COST activities and to all their 
actors, including the COST Members, the COST Governance, the COST Scientific Committee, the 
COST Administration as well as to the participants to COST activities.

COST Principles shall be further depicted in applicable level B and complemented in level C rules which 
shall be abided by. 
COST principles shall be as follows: 
3.1. 
Excellence &amp; Inclusiveness  
Excellence and Inclusiveness principle aims at fostering excellence and inclusiveness in science 
Europe-wide, offering low-barrier access to research networks, and creating interdisciplinary research 
cooperation opportunities for researchers and innovators. This principle is based on openness and 
inclusiveness, bottom-up approach and striving for excellence as depicted hereunder and shall be 
implemented through the COST Excellence and Inclusiveness Policy.  
3.1.1. OPENNESS AND INCLUSIVENESS  
COST activities shall be open and inclusive.  
COST is about people: the researchers and innovators. The success of COST activities depends on 
the ability to bring together all the relevant actors. Participation to COST activities should therefore be 
open to all. 
Participation in COST activities shall be an entry point to other European collaborative research 
networks, that allows to save costs and time to connect with the right partners.  
COST shall encourage participation from all actors, such as academics, non-academics, SMEs, 
international organisations and public authorities and civil society organisations. Participation in COST 
may also lead to follow-up in terms of proposals submitted for collaborative research in Horizon Europe. 
This underpins the role of COST as a pre-portal for follow-up European funding for research and 
innovation. 
COST and participants to COST activities shall value everyone and treat them equally and fairly, 
regardless of their gender, age, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political convictions, disabilities, or any other 
aspects.  
COST and participants to COST activities shall value diversity as an asset to its pan-European, multi-
cultural and interdisciplinary character.  
COST shall commit to promote Open Science including through Open Access of the outputs of COST 
activities, notably through the dissemination of their results and outcomes. 
COST and participants to COST activities shall ensure inclusiveness in COST activities through COST 
Inclusiveness Target Countries4 (ITC) representation, geographical diversity, gender balance and 
empowerment of young researchers. 
3.1.2. BOTTOM-UP APPROACH AND STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE 
COST activities shall be effective and impactful, which requires COST to strive for excellence, focusing 
on progressing the state-of-the-art and development of breakthroughs. On a matter of principle, topics 
of the COST activities shall be defined following a bottom-up approach. The CSO may decide to follow 
a top-down approach where appropriate.  
Excellence is an essential objective for science and technology as well as for individuals and 
organisations: it is the desire to achieve the highest quality in all endeavours, find the best solutions to 
new challenges, and contribute to tangible and intangible results and outcomes to guarantee progress 
and welfare.  
 
4 See Annex I for the list of COST Inclusiveness Target Countries.

COST shall in this regard:  
• 
Foster professionalism and cooperative attitude in all aspects of the governance, management, 
and implementation of COST activities,   
• 
Listen actively, respond, encourage teamwork, and make decisions based on facts and data, 
in an environment that encourages promotion, achievement and continuous learning in order 
to improve its own performance, 
• 
Proactively identify, assess, and manage risks in view of greater potential and impact, 
•

Provide participants to COST activities with appropriate and impartial supervision, guidance, 
and support, in order to enhance high-quality results and outcomes from COST activities,  
• 
Make relevant results and outcomes from COST activities easily available to potential end-
users in COST Members and beyond (the scientific community, business enterprises, policy 
makers, citizens, public and other stakeholders). 
3.1.3. COST EXCELLENCE AND INCLUSIVENESS POLICY 
The COST Excellence and Inclusiveness policy is developed around three main elements: 
• 
Geographical diversity, 
• 
Career stage: involving young researchers and innovators, 
• 
Gender balance. 
The COST Excellence and Inclusiveness Policy shall contribute to the objectives of the ‘Widening 
participation and strengthening the European Research Area’ Work Programme under Horizon Europe.

Where the issue cannot be mitigated at the level of the EB, the case shall be reported to the
