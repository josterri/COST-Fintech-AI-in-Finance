COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION 
on the management of intellectual property in knowledge transfer activities 
and Code of Practice for universities and other public research organisations 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 
165 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) 
When re-launching the Lisbon Strategy in 2005, the Heads of State or Government 
stressed the key role that better links between public research organisations, including 
universities, and industry can play in facilitating the circulation and use of ideas in a 
dynamic knowledge society and in enhancing competitiveness and welfare. 
(2) 
An effort should be made to better convert knowledge into socio-economic benefits. 
Therefore, public research organisations need to disseminate and to more effectively 
exploit publicly-funded research results with a view to translating them into new 
products and services. Means to realise this include in particular academia-industry 
collaborations – collaborative or contract research conducted or funded jointly with the 
private sector –, licensing and the creation of spin-offs. 
(3) 
Effectively exploiting publicly-funded research results depends on the proper 
management of intellectual property (i.e. knowledge in the broadest sense, 
encompassing e.g. inventions, software, databases and micro-organisms, whether or 
not they are protected by legal instruments such as patents), on the development of an 
entrepreneurial culture and associated skills within public research organisations, as 
well as on better communication and interaction between the public and private sector. 
(4) 
The active engagement of public research organisations in intellectual property 
management and knowledge transfer is essential for generating socio-economic 
benefits, and for attracting students, scientists and further research funding. 
(5) 
Member States have in recent years taken initiatives to facilitate knowledge transfer at 
national level, but significant discrepancies between national regulatory frameworks, 
policies and practices, as well as varying standards in the management of intellectual 
property within public research organisations, prevent or hamper trans-national 
knowledge transfer across Europe and the realisation of the European Research Area. 
(6) 
Following the 2007 Commission Communication1, setting out approaches for a 
common European framework for knowledge transfer, the European Council therefore 
invited the Commission, in June 2007, to develop guidance on the management of

intellectual property by public research organisations in the form of a 
Recommendation to Member States. 
(7) 
This Recommendation seeks to provide Member States and their regions with policy 
guidelines for the development or updating of national guidelines and frameworks, and 
public research organisations with a Code of Practice, in order to improve the way 
public research organisations manage intellectual property and knowledge transfer. 
(8) 
Collaboration in the field of research and development as well as knowledge transfer 
activities between the Community and third countries should be based on clear and 
uniform recommendations and practices that ensure equitable and fair access to 
intellectual property generated through international research collaborations, to the 
mutual benefit of all partners involved. The attached Code of Practice should be used 
as a reference in that context. 
(9) 
A number of good practices have been identified that should help Member States to 
implement this Recommendation. It is for each Member State to choose the 
procedures and practices best designed to ensure that the principles of this 
Recommendation are followed, having regard to what would be most effective in the 
context of that Member State, since practices that are effective in one Member State 
may not be as effective in another. Existing guidance provided at Community and 
OECD level should also be taken into account. 
(10) 
The Commission and the Member States should monitor the implementation of this 
Recommendation and its impact, and foster the exchange of good practices regarding 
knowledge transfer. 
HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT MEMBER STATES SHOULD: 
1. 
Ensure that all public research organisations define knowledge transfer as a strategic 
mission; 
2. 
Encourage public research organisations to establish and publicise policies and 
procedures for the management of intellectual property in line with the Code of 
Practice set out in Annex I; 
3. 
Support the development of knowledge transfer capacity and skills in public research 
organisations, as well as measures to raise the awareness and skills of students – in 
particular in the area of science and technology – regarding intellectual property, 
knowledge transfer and entrepreneurship; 
4. 
Promote the broad dissemination of knowledge created with public funds, by taking 
steps to encourage open access to research results, while enabling, where 
appropriate, the related intellectual property to be protected; 
5. 
Cooperate and take steps to improve the coherence of their respective ownership 
regimes as regards intellectual property rights in such a way as to facilitate cross-
border collaborations and knowledge transfer in the field of research and 
development; 
6. 
Use the principles outlined in this Recommendation as a basis for introducing or 
adapting national guidelines and legislation concerning the management of

  EN 
intellectual property and knowledge transfer by public research organisations, as well 
as for concluding agreements concerning research cooperation with third countries, 
or for any other measures to promote knowledge transfer, or when creating new 
related policies or funding schemes, while observing State aid rules; 
7. 
Take steps to ensure the widest possible implementation of the Code of Practice, 
whether directly or through the rules laid down by national and regional research 
funding bodies; 
8. 
Ensure equitable and fair treatment of participants from Member States and third 
countries in international research projects regarding the ownership of and access to 
intellectual property rights, to the mutual benefit of all partners involved;  
9. 
Designate a national contact point, the tasks of which should include the coordination 
of measures regarding knowledge transfer between public research organisations and 
the private sector, including tackling trans-national issues, in liaison with similar 
contact points in other Member States; 
10. 
Examine and make use of the best practices set out in Annex II, taking into account 
the national context; 
11. 
Inform the Commission by 15 July 2010 and every two years thereafter of measures 
taken on the basis of this Recommendation, as well as their impact.

ANNEX I  
Code of Practice for universities and other public research organisations concerning the 
management of intellectual property in knowledge transfer activities  
This Code of Practice consists of three main sets of principles. 
The principles for an internal intellectual property (hereinafter “IP”) policy constitute the 
basic set of principles which public research organisations should implement in order to 
effectively manage the intellectual property resulting from their – own or collaborative – 
activities in the field of research and development.  
The principles for a knowledge transfer (hereinafter “KT”) policy complement those 
relating to IP policy by focusing more specifically on the active transfer and exploitation of 
such intellectual property, regardless of whether or not it is protected by IP rights. 
The principles for collaborative and contract research are meant to concern all kinds of 
research activities conducted or funded jointly by a public research organisation and the 
private sector, including in particular collaborative research (where all parties carry out R&amp;D 
tasks) and contract research (where R&amp;D is contracted out to a public research organisation 
by a private company). 
1. 
PRINCIPLES FOR AN INTERNAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY 
1. 
Develop an IP policy as part of the long-term strategy and mission of the public 
research organisation, and publicise it internally and externally, while establishing a 
single responsible contact point. 
2. 
That policy should provide clear rules for staff and students regarding in particular 
the disclosure of new ideas with potential commercial interest, the ownership of 
research results, record keeping, the management of conflicts of interest and 
engagement with third parties. 
3. 
Promote the identification, exploitation and, where appropriate, protection of 
intellectual property, in line with the strategy and mission of the public research 
organisation and with a view to maximising socio-economic benefits. To this end, 
different strategies may be adopted – possibly differentiated in the respective 
scientific/technical areas –, for instance the &quot;public domain&quot; approach or the &quot;open 
innovation&quot; approach. 
4. 
Provide appropriate incentives to ensure that all relevant staff play an active role in 
the implementation of the IP policy. Such incentives should not only be of a financial 
nature but should also promote career progression, by considering intellectual 
property and knowledge transfer aspects in appraisal procedures, in addition to 
academic criteria. 
5. 
Consider the creation of coherent portfolios of intellectual property by the public 
research organisation – e.g. in specific technological areas – and, where appropriate, 
the setting-up of patent/IP pools including intellectual property of other public 
research organisations. This could ease exploitation, through critical mass and 
reduced transaction costs for third parties. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 6"></div><pre class="text-content">
EN

  EN 
6. 
Raise awareness and basic skills regarding intellectual property and knowledge 
transfer through training actions for students as well as research staff, and ensure 
that the staff responsible for the management of IP/KT have the required skills and 
receive adequate training. 
7. 
Develop and publicise a publication/dissemination policy promoting the broad 
dissemination of research and development results (e.g. through open access 
publication), while accepting possible delay where the protection of intellectual 
property is envisaged, although this should be kept to a minimum. 
2. 
PRINCIPLES FOR A KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER POLICY 
8. 
In order to promote the use of publicly-funded research results and maximise their 
socio-economic impact, consider all types of possible exploitation mechanisms 
(such as licensing or spin-off creation) and all possible exploitation partners (such 
as spin-offs or existing companies, other public research organisations, investors, or 
innovation support services or agencies), and select the most appropriate ones. 
9. 
While proactive IP/KT policy may generate additional revenues for the public 
research organisation, this should not be considered the prime objective. 
10. 
Ensure that the public research organisation has access to or possesses professional 
knowledge transfer services including legal, financial, commercial as well as 
intellectual property protection and enforcement advisors, in addition to staff with 
technical background. 
11. 
Develop and publicise a licensing policy, in order to harmonise practices within the 
public research organisation and ensure fairness in all deals. In particular, transfers of 
ownership of intellectual property owned by the public research organisation and the 
granting of exclusive licences2 should be carefully assessed, especially with respect 
to non-European third parties. Licences for exploitation purposes should involve 
adequate compensation, financial or otherwise. 
12. 
Develop and publicise a policy for the creation of spin-offs, allowing and 
encouraging the public research organisation&#x27;s staff to engage in the creation of spin-
offs where appropriate, and clarifying long-term relations between spin-offs and the 
public research organisation. 
13. 
Establish clear principles regarding the sharing of financial returns from 
knowledge transfer revenues between the public research organisation, the 
department and the inventors. 
14. 
Monitor intellectual property protection and knowledge transfer activities and 
related achievements, and publicise these regularly. The research results of the public 
research organisation, any related expertise and intellectual property rights should be 
made more visible to the private sector, in order to promote their exploitation. 
                                                 
2 
With regard to R&amp;D results having several possible application fields, exclusive licences granted 
without any limitation to a specific field of use should be avoided. Moreover, as a rule, the PRO should 
reserve adequate rights to facilitate dissemination and further research. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 7"></div><pre class="text-content">

  EN 
3. 
PRINCIPLES REGARDING COLLABORATIVE AND CONTRACT RESEARCH 3 
15. 
The rules governing collaborative and contract research activities should be 
compatible with the mission of each party. They should take into account the level 
of private funding and be in accordance with the objectives of the research activities, 
in particular to maximise the commercial and socio-economic impact of the research, 
to support the public research organisation&#x27;s objective to attract private research 
funding, to maintain an intellectual property position that allows further academic 
and collaborative research, and avoid impeding the dissemination of the R&amp;D 
results. 
16. 
IP-related issues should be clarified at management level and as early as possible 
in the research project, ideally before it starts. IP-related issues include allocation of 
the ownership of intellectual property which is generated in the framework of the 
project (hereinafter “foreground”), identification of the intellectual property which is 
possessed by the parties before starting the project (hereinafter “background”) and 
which is necessary for project execution or exploitation purposes, access rights4 to 
foreground and background for these purposes, and the sharing of revenues. 
17. 
In a collaborative research project, ownership of the foreground should stay with the 
party that has generated it, but can be allocated to the different parties on the basis of 
a contractual agreement concluded in advance, adequately reflecting the parties&#x27; 
respective interests, tasks and financial or other contributions to the project. In the 
case of contract research the foreground generated by the public research 
organisation is owned by the private-sector party. The ownership of background 
should not be affected by the project. 
18. 
Access rights4 should be clarified by the parties as early as possible in the research 
project, ideally before it starts. Where necessary for the purpose of conducting the 
research project, or for the exploitation of foreground of a party, access rights to 
other parties&#x27; foreground and background should be available, under conditions 
which should adequately reflect the parties&#x27; respective interests, tasks, and financial 
and other contributions to the project. 
                                                 
3 
When a PRO engages in contract or collaborative research with an industrial partner, the Commission 
will automatically (i.e. without any notification requirement) consider that no indirect State aid is 
granted to the industrial partner through the PRO if the conditions set out in the Community Framework 
for State Aid for R&amp;D&amp;I (OJ No C323 of 30.12.2006 – in particular points 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 thereof) are 
fulfilled. 
4 
Access rights refer to rights granted by the parties to each other, as opposed to licences to third parties. 
They should determine which parties can use which pieces of foreground/background, for research 
purposes and/or for exploitation purposes, and on what conditions.

ANNEX II  
Identified practices of public authorities that facilitate the management of intellectual 
property in knowledge transfer activities by universities and other public research 
organisations 
Knowledge Transfer as a strategic mission of public research organisations 
1. 
Knowledge transfer between universities and industry is made a permanent political 
and operational priority for all public research funding bodies within a Member 
State, at both national and regional level. 
2. 
The subject clearly falls within the responsibility of a ministry, which is charged with 
coordinating knowledge transfer promotion initiatives with other ministries. 
3. 
Each ministry and regional government body that carries out knowledge transfer 
activities designates an official responsible for monitoring their impact. They meet 
regularly in order to exchange information and discuss ways to improve knowledge 
transfer. 
Policies for managing Intellectual Property 
4. 
The proper management of intellectual property resulting from public funding is 
promoted, requiring that it be carried out according to established principles taking 
into account the legitimate interests of industry (e.g. temporary confidentiality 
constraints). 
5. 
Research policy promotes reliance on the private sector to help identify technological 
needs and to foster private investment in research and encourage the exploitation of 
publicly-funded research results.  
Knowledge transfer capacities and skills 
6. 
Sufficient resources and incentives are available to public research organisations and 
their staff to engage in knowledge transfer activities. 
7. 
Measures are taken to ensure the availability and facilitate the recruitment of trained 
staff (such as technology transfer officers) by public research organisations. 
8. 
A set of model contracts is made available, as well as a decision-making tool helping 
the most appropriate model contract to be selected, depending on a number of 
parameters. 
9. 
Before establishing new mechanisms to promote knowledge transfer (such as 
mobility or funding schemes), relevant stakeholder groups, including SMEs and 
large industry as well as public research organisations, are consulted. 
10. 
The pooling of resources between public research organisations at local or regional 
level is promoted where these do not have the critical mass of research spending to 
justify having their own knowledge transfer office or intellectual property manager. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 9"></div><pre class="text-content">
EN 
9 
  EN 
11. 
Programmes 
supporting 
research 
spin-offs 
are 
launched, 
incorporating 
entrepreneurship training and featuring strong interaction of public research 
organisations with local incubators, financiers, business support agencies, etc.  
12. 
Government funding is made available to support knowledge transfer and business 
engagement at public research organisations, including through hiring experts. 
Coherence in trans-national cooperation 
13. 
In order to promote transnational knowledge transfer and facilitate cooperation with 
parties from other countries, the owner of intellectual property from publicly-funded 
research is defined by clear rules and this information, together with any funding 
conditions which may affect the transfer of knowledge, is made easily available. 
Institutional ownership – as opposed to the &quot;professor&#x27;s privilege&quot; regime – is 
considered the default legal regime for intellectual property ownership at public 
research organisations in most EU Member States. 
14. 
When signing international research cooperation agreements, the terms and 
conditions relating to projects funded under both countries&#x27; schemes provide all 
participants with similar rights, especially as regards access to intellectual property 
rights and related use restrictions. 
Dissemination of knowledge  
15. 
Open access is implemented by public research funding bodies with regard to peer-
reviewed scientific publications resulting from publicly-funded research. 
16. 
Open access to research data is promoted, in line with the OECD Principles and 
Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding, taking into account 
restrictions linked to commercial exploitation. 
17. 
Archival facilities for research results (such as internet-based repositories) are 
developed with public funding in connection with open access policies.
