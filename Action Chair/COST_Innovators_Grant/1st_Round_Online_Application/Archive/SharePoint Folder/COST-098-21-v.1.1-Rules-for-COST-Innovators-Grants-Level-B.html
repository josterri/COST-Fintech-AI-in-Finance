innovations (see the definition of Innovation in the Glossary), building bridges between the 
scientific research performed in COST Actions and the applications in the market and in society; 
 
COST shall adopt a set of stable, minimal, and user-friendly rules to ensure efficient, effective, 
and impactful implementation of CIGs. 
 
Adopts the present Rules for CIGs in accordance with the Rules and Principles for COST activities, 
which shall apply to COST Members, COST Governance, COST Administration and to participants to 
the CIGs. 
The present Rules for CIGs shall be subordinated to and shall not contravene the “Rules and Principles 
for COST activities”. In case of any contradiction, the Rules and Principles for COST activities shall

Guidelines (http://www.cost.eu/innovators_grant). 
1.2. Objectives of CIGs 
The CIG Terms of Reference, constituting the addendum to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
of the Action, shall describe the aims and objectives of the CIGs as approved by the CSO.  
2. CIG START DATE AND DURATION 
A CIG shall start at the beginning of the Grant Period following the CSO approval and shall have a 
duration of 12 months.  
No extension shall be granted, unless the COST Executive Board decides to offer an extension to CIGs 
affected by a case of force majeure (see the definition of force majeure in the Glossary), which resulted

shall in such case determine the duration of the extension based on the Rules of Procedures defined 
by the EB. Those Rules of Procedures shall be published. 
 
The CSO may terminate a CIG in case of:  
 
Circumstances that from a Science and Technology or network activities point of view make the 
benefit of continuing the CIG questionable. Those circumstances shall be duly justified following 
the breach of COST Action rules and principles by the CIG Team as per Rules and Principles 
for COST activities, Article 6. 
3. CIG MANAGEMENT 
CIGs shall be managed by the CIG Team. The CIG Team composition is detailed in the CIG application 
and approved by the CSO upon approval of the CIG applications to be funded.

expert from a COST Full or Cooperating Members capable of fulfilling their role (e.g., same expertise), 
or the CIG Team takes over their role, and a clear justification and rationale for the choice shall be 
provided.
