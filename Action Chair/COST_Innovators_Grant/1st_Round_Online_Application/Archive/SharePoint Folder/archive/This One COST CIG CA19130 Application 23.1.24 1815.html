Application title 
VisionXAI: Pioneering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI 
Standards in European Finance with a Policy-Focused Impact 
Application acronym  
VisionXAI 
Code of COST Action 
from which the CIG 
application originates 
CA19130 
Submitter (must be 
Action Chair/ Vice Chair) 
Joerg Osterrieder, joerg.osterrieder@utwente.nl 
Origin of CIG application 
in the Action  
Since its inception in September 2020, the COST Action CA19130 
focusing on transparency in European finance has rapidly become one 
of the most active, with over 34 official meetings and a network 
exceeding 380 working group members. With 40 COST countries 
participating, a dissemination platform with more than 3500 members 
and activities exceeding 6000 participants, this COST Action has had a 
substantial impact on the theoretical and practical foundations of 
explainable Artificial Intelligence. As an example for the outreach 
activities, we mention a two-day policy workshop on the premises of 
COST, with senior speakers from the European Commission and 
Parliament. 
Over the past three years, the Action has laid a robust theoretical 
foundation in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in explainable AI, 
evidenced by over 6000 annual citations of its academic papers. 
Through extensive outreach, it has made vital connections with industry 
leaders, regulators, and other stakeholders.  
During those interactions, it became evident that a visual analytics tool 
for showing the explainability of Artificial Intelligence computations is 
needed both to satisfy the requirements of the European regulators 
(among them the ECB, EBA, ESMA, EIOPA, European Data Protection 
Board EDPB, SSM, European Systemic Risk Board ESRB), answering 
to pressing needs of the industry as well as the end-users of the 
products. 
Therefore, VisionXAI represents a strategic evolution of the COST 
CA19130 Action’s objectives, transforming theoretical AI research into 
a tangible visual analytics tool that adheres to EU regulatory standards. 
The project’s aim to develop a visual analytics tool for explainable AI in 
the financial sector directly addresses the need for greater transparency 
and policy alignment in FinTech. It encapsulates the Action&#x27;s 
commitment to bridging academia and industry, fostering innovation, 
and driving strategic development in the financial technology domain. 
VisionXAI is not just a product but a proof of CA19130’s interdisciplinary 
approach, setting a new standard for products leveraging Artificial 
Intelligence in alignment with European financial policies and 
regulations.

Summary (for 
publication if the 
application is approved) 
It is advised that the Action Grant Holder continues. If this is not 
possible, the new Grant Holder institution shall be the affiliation of one 
of the CIG Team members. 
Our CIG project centres on the development of VisionXAI, a visual 
analytics tool designed for the European financial sector to make 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) more transparent and understandable. In 
today&#x27;s financial landscape, AI plays a pivotal role in decision-making 
processes. However, the complex nature of AI systems often makes 
their decisions opaque, leading to a lack of trust among users, including 
financial analysts, regulators, and the general public. This gap in 
understanding and trust poses a significant challenge, especially 
considering the stringent regulatory environment of the European 
Union. 
VisionXAI aims to bridge this gap by providing clear, visual 
interpretations of AI decisions, thereby demystifying complex AI models 
and making them more accessible and accountable. The tool is 
specifically tailored to meet the diverse needs of various stakeholders

in the financial sector. Whether it&#x27;s a regulator requiring compliance with 
financial policies, a financial analyst seeking deeper insights, or an end-
user needing clarity on AI-driven decisions, VisionXAI delivers 
audience-specific outputs to cater to these varied explainability 
requirements. 
A key feature of VisionXAI is its emphasis on policy implications. The 
tool is designed to ensure that the AI-driven insights it provides align 
with European financial policies and regulations, aiding in compliance 
and informed decision-making. Moreover, VisionXAI addresses 
explainability comprehensively by considering it at every stage of the AI 
model development, including the data collection phase. This approach 
helps in identifying and mitigating potential biases in the underlying 
data, promoting fairness and integrity in AI-driven financial decisions. 
The expected outcome of the VisionXAI project is multi-fold. Primarily, 
it will be a business plan for a visual analytics tool for explainable AI 
(XAI). The tool aims to set a standard for explainable AI in the European 
financial sector, enhancing transparency and trust in AI applications. 
This is crucial for reducing biases in AI-driven financial decisions and 
aligning these decisions with regulatory standards. The broader 
adoption and standardisation of VisionXAI across European financial 
institutions and regulatory bodies are anticipated, establishing it as an 
essential component of the AI systems used in finance. This not only 
enhances transparency and compliance but also improves the overall 
decision-making process in finance.

1. INNOVATION POTENTIAL 
1.1  WHAT IS THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGE AND TARGET GROUP THAT YOU WILL 
ADDRESS 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising technology-driven fields, offering significant innovation 
opportunities in finance (Dingli et al., 2017, Di Persio et al. 2017, Sen et al., 2021, Yang, 2021, Shi et 
al., 2022). Yet, its widespread adoption hinges on trust in its outputs (Doshi-Velez and Kim, 2017, 
Miller, 2018, Moscatelli et al., 2019, Cascarino et al., 2022, Madabu et al., 2022). Despite the growing 
popularity of the topic, a key gap in explainable AI within the finance sector is the lack of 
methodologies for interpreting complex, high-dimensional financial models in a way that is both 
accessible to non-experts (Hadji Misheva, 2021 and Weber, 2023) and compliant with evolving 
regulatory standards, presenting a prime opportunity for an innovative project aimed at bridging this 
divide. Building on the identified gap, the project will focus on creating a visual analytics (VA) 
tool that not only demystifies complex financial models for non-experts but also adheres to 
European regulatory requirements, setting a new standard for explainable AI, providing a 
clear, interactive, and user-friendly interface to understand AI-driven financial insights. 
The gap in explainable AI (XAI) in finance can be attributed to a variety of practical challenges. A 
primary issue is the suitability of existing XAI methods for the diverse stakeholders within the financial 
value chain, including model developers, risk experts, model auditors, and end-users. Each group 
requires different levels of explainability and forms of visualisations that can convey complex AI-driven 
insights in a comprehensible and actionable manner (Holstein et al., 2019, Bhatt et al., 2020 and 
Hadji Misheva et al. 2021). The challenge is to create visual tools that can cater to these varied 
requirements, with accessible explanations, relevant to all stakeholders. Furthermore, there is a 
mismatch between theoretical XAI approaches and the practical needs of the industry. Theoretical 
models fail to address the specific, real-world complexities of financial applications (i.e. scalability 
issues (Bertossi et al., 2021) or feature dependence issues (Molnar, 2019 and Kumar, 2020)). Bias, 
fairness and data integrity in ML models also pose significant hurdles (Grupa et al. 2021). Although 
numerous bias detection and mitigation techniques are available in the literature (Prakhar et al., 
2023), there is a gap targeting financial data, with its high-dimensional input spaces (Ali et al., 2023). 
Aligning AI systems in finance with European AI regulations, such as the GDPR, EBA guidelines, 
ECB standards, and the proposed EU AI Act, adds another layer of complexity.  
Target audience: 
• European Financial Institutions such as banks, investment, and insurance companies. The 
research team has established connections with Deloitte, Swedbank, Raiffeisen Bank, Vontobel, 
ING, all of which have confirmed their interest with us and are increasingly integrating AI within 
the stringent EU regulatory framework. With the solution, they can access comprehensive 
documentation and examples on the end-to-end process of training ML and deep learning (DL) 
models on risk management use cases. They will also access novel context-specific bias 
mitigation and explainability methods.  
• European Regulatory Bodies, like the ECB (Department on Risk Management and Supervision 
team on AI methodologies), ESMA, the BIS (Department on Risk Methodologies, Department of 
IT), all of which need tools to effectively evaluate and monitor AI applications in finance. With the 
CIG solution, these agents will have a better understanding on how complex models are built and 
what type of processes are in place to ensure fairness and explainability standards.  
• AI Developers and Data Scientists, who are required to align AI models with EU financial 
regulations and standards, will benefit from the CIG visual analytics solution as it will provide 
them with a functional AI playground and detailed access to code, scripts and data to replicate 
novel methods and visualisations developed by the consortium. 
• Policy Makers and Legislators, like the European Commision and the team leading the AI Act 
involved in formulating and refining AI regulation in the financial sector, will benefit as it will help 
them further specify regulation on explainability requirements for different audiences.  
• End-Users in the EU Finance Sector at large (like the European Consumers Union (ECU)), who 
require transparent and understandable AI tools for decision-making. The solution&#x27;s user-friendly 
interface and comprehensive documentation provide valuable insights into how AI decisions are 
made and the potential biases involved, fostering greater awareness and informed dialogue about 
AI use in society. 
1.2  WHAT IS YOUR PROPOSED SOLUTION AND THE MAIN OUTCOMES OF THE CIG 
The proposed solution is the development of a visual analytics tool for explainable AI, specifically 
tailored to the needs of the European financial sector. The features of the VA tool are outlined below:  
• User-specific interpretations and visualizations. The VA will: (i) customizes explanations and 
visualizations to meet the specific explainability needs of various user groups, (ii) provide an 
overall score indicating the degree to which the AI model aligns with expert financial reasoning 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 9"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 9 
and (iii) offer insights into the key features driving the model’s outputs. 
• Data &amp; algorithmic bias score. The VA will also incorporate a quantitative measure to assess 
the level of bias within the dataset or algorithm and helps users understand and address potential 
skewness in data or decision-making processes. 
• Regulatory compliance score. The VA will help users evaluate how well the data, model, and 
interpretations adhere to current financial regulations. 
In addition, the tool will also allow users to drill down to any level of detail concerning the deployment 
of the tool and all documentation related with the data used, code developed, and novel analytical 
and visualisation tools proposed. 
In terms of main outcomes, the VA tool will serve as a cornerstone in establishing a XAI standard in 
the European financial sector, enhancing policy compliance and alignment with European financial 
regulations. It will significantly improve the transparency and trustworthiness of AI applications 
in finance, effectively reducing biases in AI-driven financial decisions. Additionally, this tool will 
contribute valuable insights to XAI research, particularly in visual analytics, and will be supported by 
a comprehensive business plan detailing strategies for implementation, market penetration, 
and growth in the financial sector. The primary endpoint of the project is to achieve broad 
adoption and standardisation of explainability practices across European financial 
institutions and regulatory bodies, establishing it as a standard practice within the industry. 
1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE CIG 
Primary objective 1: The main goal of this project is the development of a SaaS-based visual 
analytics tool, accessible in a Cloud Computing environment, specifically designed for 
explainable AI in the European finance sector that will be compliant with evolving European 
regulatory standards, and accessible to audiences of different explainability requirements and 
levels of technical knowledge, together with an appropriate business plan. The specificity of the 
project lies in its targeted design for financial AI applications, addressing a clear market need. In 
terms of measurability, the goal is to complete the development of this tool and begin user testing 
within 6 months, setting a clear timeline for progress assessment. The project is achievable as it 
builds upon existing XAI frameworks, adapting and integrating new features tailored to the intricacies 
of financial data. Its relevance is underscored by the increasing demand for transparency in AI 
decision-making processes within the stringent regulatory environment of EU finance. The topic is 
timely, aiming to deliver a complete, market-ready version of the tool within 12 months. The outcomes 
are aligned with the European Union’s strategies on Digital Finance and AI. 
Secondary objective 1: To map out and match various XAI methods with the diverse explainability 
needs in the European finance sector, highlighting the gaps between theoretical interpretability and 
practical requirements. The aim is to create more intuitive and user-friendly visualisations that can 
convey complex AI decisions effectively. 
Secondary objective 2: To identify and address any deployment issues associated with the identified 
XAI methods. The CIG will aim to integrate XAI methods that are easily scalable and valid even under 
the assumption of correlated input features. 
Secondary objective 3: To identify and incorporate all European financial policies and regulations 
that impact AI deployment in the finance sector.  
Secondary objective 4: To define a framework for robust bias detection and mitigation applicable to 
high-dimensional, correlated financial data. 
Secondary objective 5: To operationalize the VA tool, i.e. build a SaaS-based solution that offers 
intuitive, customizable visualization tools for varied expertise levels, ensures regulatory compliance, 
provides plain-language interpretability reports, and ensures data security, all while being scalable 
and user-friendly with robust support and training resources. 
Primary objective 2: To develop a comprehensive business plan outlining the strategy for 
implementing, scaling, and commercialising the visual analytics tool within the finance sector. This 
plan encompasses market analysis, deployment strategies, potential revenue models, and 
sustainability measures, ensuring the tool&#x27;s long-term impact and viability in the financial industry. 
1.4 WHAT IS INNOVATIVE ABOUT YOUR SOLUTION 
The innovative tool for XAI in finance stands out due to its comprehensive features and compliance-
focused design, which are not present in existing solutions: 
1. Business-Oriented Prototype: Converts academic research to spark the development of 
successful business plans and products using XAI. 
2. User-Centric Explanations: Tailors XAI methods to the specific needs of different user groups 
within the financial sector. 
3. Specialized Visual Analytics: Features audience-dependent visual analytics that are scalable 
and maintain validity even with feature dependence. 
4. Data &amp; Algorithmic Bias Score: Provides users with a quantitative measure to assess and 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 10"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 10 
articulate the bias within financial datasets and models. 
5. Regulatory Compliance: Assures that data, models, and interpretations align with current 
regulations, satisfying the diverse explainability needs of financial stakeholders. The solution will 
be specifically crafted for the European financial market, ensuring adherence to GDPR, EBA 
guidelines, and the EU AI Act. 
6. High level report: Enables non-technical audiences to have high-level conclusions concerning 
the degree to which the AI model aligns with expert financial reasoning and relevant regulations.  
7. Detailed Documentation: Allows users comprehensive access to documentation regarding data 
usage, code development, and innovative analytical and visualization tools. 
This tool significantly advances the field of XAI by integrating state-of-the-art techniques that 
effectively manage complex data and address bias, areas where existing methods often fall short. 
2. EXPECTED IMPACT 
2.1  DESCRIBE WHO AND/ OR WHAT WILL BENEFIT, HOW, WHEN AND TO WHICH EXTENT 
The CIG will have a major impact in all of the nine primary scientific, economic/technological and 
societal Key-Impact Pathways of Europe, both in the short and long run. It will impactall larger 
European banks, Fintechs across the EU, government agencies (ECB, BIS) and the end-user. We 
have substantial preliminary interest specifically from the ECB and BIS on such a tool and will work 
with them over the next three years. 
A. 
Economic and technological Impact 
Short-Term Perspective (within 12 months): 
• 
Novel, audience-specific visualisations of explanations. (BIS IT team, ECB AI team)  
• 
Scalable application deployment. The CIG will integrate XAI methods that are scalable and 
can handle correlated input features (European Fintechs, Banks, e.g. ING). 
• 
Technical advancements. The open-source nature of the toolkit will facilitate knowledge sharing 
and collaboration among researchers, developers, and practitioners, leading to the development 
of innovative XAI techniques. 
• 
Visual Analytics Framework. The VA tool will enable different users to understand: the data 
pre-processing, the bias mitigation strategies, the feature selection process, and ultimately the 
training and testing of the AI-based system.  
Long-Term Perspective (within 24 - 36 month): Sustained and Expansive Impacts in Finance 
• 
Setting New XAI Standards: The guidelines and models developed for fairness, and 
explainability will likely become industry standards. Financial technology firms will adhere to these 
models, ensuring a consistent level of AI transparency across the sector. 
• 
Novel, domain-specific bias detection and mitigation techniques. Defining a framework for 
bias detection and mitigation in AI-driven decisions is to ensure fairness and integrity. Financial 
data is influenced by a myriad of socio-economic factors that need to be unbiased.  
• 
Innovative Financial Tools: We anticipate 15 new AI-driven financial tools and 10 sustainable 
digital finance tools within three by the end of the Action as well as five potential IPR applications 
for unique methodologies in AI and sustainable finance. 
• 
Investment Mobilization: The CIG will draw several millions in PPIs within five years.  
• 
Cost Savings in Compliance and Risk Management: Financial institutions spend a significant 
portion of their budget on compliance, estimated to be around 15-20% of their total operational 
costs. Implementing XAI can reduce these costs by improving the efficiency of compliance 
processes. For instance, if XAI reduces these costs by even 5%, for a bank with $1 billion in 
operational costs, this would mean savings of $50 million to $100 million. 
B. Societal Impact 
• 
Enhanced trust and transparency in the financial sector: The toolkit will facilitate informed 
decision-making among users, for a more trustworthy and transparent financial ecosystem. 
• 
Compliance with regulations. The toolkit will provide clear guidance and tools for ensuring 
compliance with AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act. 
• 
Accountability and transparency in AI. XAI will promote a culture of accountability and 
transparency in the use of AI, ensuring that AI systems are used responsibly and ethically. 
• 
Fairness and Bias Mitigation. Higher transparency facilitated by XAI contributes to increased 
awareness of potential biases, reinforcing a commitment to fairness in AI applications.  
C. Scientific Impact  
• 
Addressing EU Policy Priorities and Global Challenges through Research and Innovation: 
By emphasising XAI and digital transformation, our Action directly aligns with Europe&#x27;s strategic 
priorities to establish itself as a frontrunner in digital innovation while addressing environmental 
and ethical considerations (EU Digital Finance Package, EU Green Deal, European Approach to 
Artificial Intelligence). 
• 
Scientific output: The CIG will produce several scientific papers on XAI and their implementation 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 11"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 11 
in the industry. A target journal is e.g. The Journal of Financial Innovation. 
These benefits will realise progressively with immediate impacts seen in the form of enhanced 
regulatory compliance and increased confidence in AI-driven financial tools. Long-term benefits will 
include more robust financial markets, informed regulatory frameworks, and a more AI-literate society. 
2.2 PLAN FOR EXPLOITATION 
Our network has substantial connections with industry, such as the Global Analytics and market 
risk teams at ING, the AI supervisory team at the European Central Bank, the IT team at BIS, the risk 
analytics teams at UBS and Deutsche Bank, and is well integrated into the European academia-
industry networks, such as a European MSCA PhD and Research Programme on Digital Finance, 
the European Consortium on Mathematics for Industry, EIT Digital, and European industry and 
consumer associations such as several national Fintech and financial consumer association. Over 
the last year, a majority of them have expressed the need and desire for the prototype of a XAI tool 
we are proposing. Those companies and end-user representatives will be invited to the kick-off 
meeting, to collect early feedback and input as well as the two main follow-up meetings to ensure 
suitability for them. Besides large companies, we have been working with a few Fintech companies 
(in Germany, Switzerland, Italy) that have shown interest to commercially exploit a prototype. 
Dissemination of research results and the XAI tool. Using the synergies of other European 
research consortia, the CIG members will organise their own large conference to showcase the 
technological advancements on the XAI tool, a policy event in Brussels for the regulatory results and 
requirements and the annual open science festival in Amsterdam to reach the end-user. We also use 
standard channels such as our website, LinkedIn, blog, and Twitter. Newspapers, social media, and 
public demonstrations will be utilised to reach the public (e.g., one lab day and several public talks). 
Members of CIG have organised over 120 research and industry-focused conferences, 
workshops, and roundtable sessions, which were attended by over 6,000 individuals from 
academia, 
industry, 
the 
regulatory 
community, 
and 
the 
general 
public 
(https://www.meetup.com/Fintech AI in Finance/ with 2000 participants). We will use 
https://www.alphagalileo.org/en-gb/ to disseminate significant findings to 5,000 journalists and 
potentially 2 million consumers.  
Through use case presentations at various industry-focused meetings, workshops, and roundtable 
sessions, as well as media releases, news articles, and blog posts published on our website, 
LinkedIn, and similar channels, the industry community will be reached. 
Exploitation of results. The topics within this CIG are crucial for the European Finance industry to 
be able to compete on a global scale within the next decade hence the exploitation methods 
envisioned are: 
Further internal research. Results will feed into subsequent research in the fields of ML for industry 
and computer science, also outside Finance. 
Collaborative research. The results will help shape future collaborative research, such as via an 
Eureka application, a new COST Action and an EU H2020 Widening application, as agreed upon by 
all CIG members. 
Collaborative, industry-focused projects. Our findings result in a prototype and multiple use 
cases. In the sequel, they will need to be refined and adapted to the industry&#x27;s shifting requirements. 
Together with industry, CIG members will seek international funding for additional projects. 
Product development. The CIG will result in one proof-of-concept solution for the industry-
specific requirements for a domain-specific XAI tool. These will be transformed into actual 
products by industry, which necessitates ongoing cooperation. 
Education. The output of research will feed back into education, e.g. via the MSCA Doctoral 
network on Digital Finance and EIT Digital.  
Standardisation. The CIG research will produce a standardised framework for a XAI tool tailored to 
EU regulatory needs based on the Data Hub of the EU Digital Finance Platform.  
Exploitation across industries. Due to the fundamental methods and techniques (ML, AI, RL) we 
employ, our outcomes will not only benefit the Finance industry, but also a number of other 
industries. A Policy paper will be beneficial to regulators (e.g. ECB). Over the past years, members 
of CIG have organised training and demonstrations for non-technical audiences (regulators, 
supervisors, and the general public, including all 28 European regulatory authorities) through EU-
funded projects (https://fintech-ho2020.eu/). These contacts will be actively maintained. 
Barriers to exploitation and how we address them. Barriers to exploitation exist: Inadequate 
financing to go from prototype to business product. Given the substantial amount of VC funding 
that goes into XAI, this is extremely unlikely. We will begin with a minimum viable product and then 
scale up. All IP issues will be discussed well in advance of any new discoveries or 
commercializations. Industry and academia collaborate from day one, and all research is 
continuously validated by industry.

3.2 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS 
The main goal of this CIG is to achieve sustainable business success via the technological 
implementation of the research results into a visual analytics tool for explainable Artificial 
Intelligence, that will be commercially exploited by industry and the CIG members as a foundation for 
future products. We estimate the likelihood of IP topics to arise during the CIG as very high. Therefore, 
an IP strategy is a must.  
In our case, specifically the unique algorithms and the user interfaces of our AI tool will need 
an appropriate IP protection, via patents for algorithms and trademarks for user interfaces. 
The CIG will follow the agreement of COST with the European Commission to implement the 
principles set out in the Code of Practice annexed to the Commission’s Recommendation on IP 
management and will therefore develop an IP policy. Many of the CIG members are well 
experienced with IP rules and this consortium has, in various EU H2020 and Horizon Europe 
settings, already implemented several IP agreements, lastly as part of a new MSCA Industrial 
Doctoral Network on Digital Finance, following the HE IP regulations. 
Our CIG network has agreed to implement an IP strategy before the start of the CIG and revise it 
as needed. Specifically: 
Before the start of the CIG: All CIG members have existing IP regulations in place as part of their 
long-term strategy to exploit publicly-funded research results in line with European regulations. All 
partners will provide their pre-existing knowledge, which will undergo a detailed pre-audit. Each team 
member has agreed to undergo an IP knowledge and training course, offered by members of our 
CIG. 
The CIG will develop the specifics of the IP policy, the dissemination and knowledge transfer strategy 
in a pre-meeting. The underlying principles have already been agreed to by all. 
During the Action: We will work together with the European IPR Helpdesk to create the IP contract. 
The legal teams of each institution, well experienced in academia-industry IP regulations via many 
EU H2020 projects and industry spin-offs, will be available, should any issues arise. The IP 
regulations will define the access rights and the sharing of revenues, proportional to the contribution 
of each member, measured via the technological and time contributions.The Action will actively work 
towards one commercial spin-off from this project as well as at least two industrial collaborations with 
a clearly defined IP regulation. All partners have agreed to follow the following dispute management, 
in line with public procurement rules: Any dispute shall be submitted to mediation in accordance with 
the WIPO Mediation Rules. The place of mediation shall be Brussels (Belgium). If the dispute cannot 
be solved by the help of mediation, it shall be finally settled by the courts of Brussels. Should new 
technological results or opportunities for exploitation arise, IP considerations will be taken into 
account during the research. We will adapt to the project&#x27;s evolving nature. 
After the Action: The IP regulations will stay in place and the members will continue to actively 
exploit the research outcome to transfer them to economically viable products and business models 
Partners will continue to work together on those topics in various settings, such as further Horizon 
Europe projects. Using the EUREKA scheme, CIG members will work with industry to further exploit 
the results. IP Rights are fundamental for safeguarding the innovative algorithms and user 
interfaces of our visual analytics tool for the European Finance Industry and European 
Government Agencies, ensuring that the ideas, technologies, and methodologies developed are 
properly attributed, protected and converted to successful economic products.
