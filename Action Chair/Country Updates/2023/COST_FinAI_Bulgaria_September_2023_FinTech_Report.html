In 2023, we remain committed to
bringing the above-mentioned key
stakeholders together and creating
Bulgaria as the leading FinTech hub in
Southeastern Europe. 
At 
this 
point, 
I 
would 
like 
to
congratulate BFA&#x27;s team, FinTech&#x27;s
representatives, and all who have
contributed 
their 
knowledge 
and
expertise to this important report.

INTRODUCTION
With the reopening of economies and
the slowing down of the Covid-19
pandemic, we see that the hype
around FinTech is fading away giving
space 
to 
sustainable 
financial
products 
and 
services. 
These
sustainable 
business 
models 
are
especially the ones we represent and
what we consider proper FinTechs.
PREFACE
THE CLUSTER
What started five years ago as a group
of 
some 
of 
the 
most 
prominent
FinTech companies and professionals
in the country, and with the help of
the whole team and all our partners,
has now evolved into a non-for-profit
for-impact 
cluster 
organisation,
uniting the key stakeholders in the
region towards a higher goal - to
improve the prosperity of a nation
through 
the 
development 
of 
an
emerging industry. 
At the Association we believe that
FinTech is one of the few economic
chances for Bulgaria to be among the
business leaders in the European
Union. Undoubtedly, this could only
happen 
with 
a 
well-developed
internal market, highly efficient and
effective public institutions, and a
well-organise educational system that
maintains a rich talent pool that is
able to answer the current business
needs. To achieve all of the above, we
apply 
daily 
the 
Quadruple 
Helix
model of innovation which stipulates
the cooperation between private and
public sectors, academia, and civil
society. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 5"></div><pre class="text-content">
The digital revolution is a key aspect
of all fields of life, including the
financial sector, and digitalization is
already an important part of modern
trends. 
Traditional 
financial
institutions today are facing serious
competition which accelerates their
transformation via the adoption of
digital 
solutions 
and 
close
cooperation with fintech players. Due
to digitalization different financial
business models that did not exist
before have entered the market. Many
of them shape the entire industry. 
Digital innovation in financial services
has brought major improvements in
the 
connectivity 
of 
systems, 
in
computing power and cost, and in
newly created and usable data. These
improvements have had a positive
impact on transaction costs and have
given rise to new business models and
new 
entrants. 
As 
technology 
has
increased information exchange and
has reduced transaction costs, the
way financial services are provided
has also changed. 
The rapid onset of the new digital age
in financial markets leads to the
necessity to adopt a new regulatory
approach and requirements. In this
regard, 
a 
significant 
package 
of
legislative 
measures 
has 
been
adopted at the European level. The
package establishes a completely new
and innovative regulatory framework
for 
digital 
finance 
and 
the
digitalization of financial services. It

of which are expected to be finalized

market (eIDAS Regulation)– aiming to
support the European Digital Identity
Wallet by including the electronic
ledgers based on DLT;
-Data Act – the initiative in some of its
sections envisages the use of DLT for
the conclusion of smart contracts.
Defining 
a 
common 
regulatory
framework in the EU is vital for an
efficient 
digital 
transformation 
of
financial services. In this respect, the
Ministry of Finance will continue to
work actively in order to implement
effectively the new policy set in the
national legislation. In this regard,
allow me to express our gratitude to
the Bulgarian Fintech Association for
its 
active 
role 
and 
constructive
contribution to the legislative process. 
The digital transformation of financial
services 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
set 
of
important policy issues in terms of
competition, 
regulatory 
perimeters
and ensuring a level playing field. To
navigate this new territory effectively
and to balance the necessary policy
goals, authorities need to collaborate
both domestically – between central
banks, 
financial 
sector 
regulators,
other 
industry 
regulators, 
and
competition 
and 
data 
protection
authorities, and across borders. Let 
me 
take 
this 
opportunity 
to
acknowledge 
the 
excellent
cooperation between all stakeholders
at 
national 
level 
and 
the 
strong
commitment 
of 
the 
supervisory
authorities - the Bulgarian National
Bank and the Financial Supervision
Commission. 
Currently, policymakers are working
actively on a variety of initiatives to
identify and manage effectively the
potential 
risks 
that 
these 
new
business models bring to the financial
sector 
while 
supporting 
an
environment fostering innovation. The
Fintech sector plays a vital role and
takes a substantial part of the new
technology solutions and the digital
transformation 
itself. 
Fintech
developments have the potential to
materially enhance, transform and
improve 
efficiency 
of 
business
models, 
applications, 
regulatory
oversight, processes or products in
many areas of the financial services
industry. In that regard, the recent
trend of FinTech companies offering
more sustainable products that have
a positive and significant effect on
financial stability is commendable. 
I would like to take this opportunity
and to congratulate the Bulgarian
Fintech sector, and in particular the
Bulgarian Fintech Association, for the
active and very important role that
they 
are 
playing 
in 
the 
digital
transformation of the financial sector
of Bulgaria, as well as for their
activities 
and 
support 
aimed 
at
positioning our country as a leading
FinTech center in the region.

ANALYSIS 2022
To show the progress of the Bulgarian FinTech ecosystem throughout the years, we
employ both qualitative and quantitative methods of research. For the former, we
perform a financial analysis based on public data from the Commercial Register of the
Republic of Bulgaria. Since the Commercial Register is updated frequently, the
presented data should be considered accurate but not exhaustive. The qualitative
research is conducted through an Annual FinTech Survey. This year, together with our
research we also present the Mastercard&#x27;s Digital Payment Index 2021, which reveals
the consumer side of the FinTech market in Bulgaria.
In 
2022, 
we 
found 
156 
FinTech
companies matching the definition
for 
a 
FinTech 
firm 
of 
the 
most
comprehensive 
FinTech 
taxonomy
globally - the Taxonomy of FinTech of

2021:
STAGNATION IS
OVERCOME
For the last 5 years, the Bulgarian
FinTech industry has increased its
operating revenue at a similar pace to
the dynamics of total revenue. It is
interesting to note that the industry
managed to overcome the stagnation
which could be observed in the years
2018-2020.
These

SUMMARY
DEYAN RADEV, PHD
DIRECTOR OF CEE CENTRE FOR
DIGITAL FINANCE
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF 
FINTECH AND BANKING
While 2020 was marked by lockdowns
and disruptions to the global supply
chains of goods and services due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was the
year of global recovery.
The results from the FinTech Market
Analysis 2022 confirm the positive
trend for the sector documented in
BFA&#x27;s Annual FinTech Report 2021 for
data until 2020. 
The Bulgarian FinTech ecosystem saw
9 new entries and a double-digit
growth across all Key Performance
Indicators in our analysis: Total Assets,
Total Revenue, Operating Revenue, 
 and Total Personnel Number. The
growth of the latter is mainly driven
by the promising segment of digital
assets.
FinTech remains the most attractive
sector for VC funding with 20% of the
total attracted VC capital at the
national level. This also shows that
Bulgaria 
offers 
an 
attractive
environment for investors and FinTech
entrepreneurs.
Our data shows that the FinTech
sector has managed to double its
productivity 
since 
2017, 
primarily
driven by technology transfer after the
Referendum 
for 
Brexit. 
This
technological shift has helped the

FINTECH MARKET
ANALYSIS 2022
sector to weather well the COVID-19
pandemic and take full advantage of
the 
demand 
for 
digital 
financial
solutions during and after the crisis. 
In conclusion, despite its early stage
of 
development, 
the 
Bulgarian
FinTech sector proves to be flexible
and resilient to external shocks and
therefore 
can 
be 
considered 
a
promising driver and facilitator of the
transition of the Bulgarian economy
to 
Industry 
4.0 
on 
the 
way 
to
economic growth and prosperity.

DIGITAL PAYMENT
INDEX - 2021 - 
BULGARIA 
The Digital Payment Index (DPI) is one of the most in-depth studies of the market of
digital payments that Mastercard have conducted so far. Following a successful launch
for Hungary in 2021, this year the Index was replicated in 6 additional countries: Austria,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Serbia and Romania. The Index aims to provide a holistic,
annual view of digital payments trends with both quantitative and qualitative insights.
This is achieved by quantifying market development in Bulgaria and comparing its
maturity to the other participating countries in three critical pillars that outline the
main structure of the index: Infrastructure, Knowledge, and Usage.
It combines statistical data from public sources and Mastercard covering 2021 with
bespoke primary research findings from the beginning of 2022. DPI is designed and
structured in a way to be able to flexibly handle market evolution (e.g., introduction of
new payment solutions) and cross-country comparison.

The Index considers a great potential
for the growth of the use of various
digital payment methods in Bulgaria - 
the well-developed infrastructure and
the high awareness of users are a 
stable basis for the growth of the use
of various solutions. 
According to the survey, a large
segment 
of 
Bulgarian 
consumers
(45%) does not receive their full salary
digitally. Receiving income in cash
limits 
the 
adoption 
of 
cashless

that’s 
the
biggest challenge in front of the

a study by:
VANYA MANOVA
COUNTRY MANAGER BULGARIA,

KOSOVO AT MASTERCARD
As the world goes through one of the
most challenging economic periods in
history, there is a need to transition to
a more robust, digitally-focused, and
sustainable economy – a move that
will reshape everything from how
transit 
systems 
run 
and 
welfare
benefits are distributed to how ESG
commitments for net-zero emissions
are pursued. Digital payments have a
major 
role 
to 
play 
in 
this
transformative process.
As a global technology company,
Mastercard has a mission to connect
and 
power 
an 
inclusive, 
digital
economy 
that 
benefits 
everyone,
everywhere by making payments (but
not only) safe, simple, smart, and
accessible. There&#x27;s a lot of value that
gets created in the form of data, in the
form of capability, that enables other
organizations, like governments and
financial institutions, to take it to a
second level to the benefit of the
players in the ecosystem.
Together we have achieved much
progress in furthering the role of
digital payments. Now, with the Index
to provide a qualitative measure of 
market development progress, we can
focus our efforts and do so much
more.

MARKET RESEARCH -
ANNUAL FINTECH
SURVEY 2022
For a fourth year in a roll, Bulgarian FinTech Association conducts a FinTech survey in
Bulgaria to track the community&#x27;s trends. Although the findings might not be
considered wholly representative of the ecosystem, it is still a powerful tool to
showcase the tendencies within the industry and some of its characteristics. The
following qualitative analysis shows the ecosystem is vital and strives for improvement.
In 
2022, 
17 
FinTech 
companies
participated in the FinTech survey. The
composition of the respondents shows
that 76% of respondents are SMEs,
compared to 93% found in this year&#x27;s
Market analysis.
The composition of FinTech entities in
the region indicates that the market is
still emerging. The young structure of
the ecosystem makes the industry
flexible to changes but at the same
time might signal a lack of experience.
The survey reveals that the most
significant part of FinTech founders&#x27;
background is in Finance. Only 6% are
those 
coming 
with 
a 
Technology
major and the same for Marketing
and Business Administration. This is
to show that the Bulgarian FinTech
ecosystem is deeply rooted in the
financial sector, working on finding
solutions to solve traditional Finance
issues.

The Annual FinTech Survey 2022 focuses on the obstacles and challenges the
ecosystem faces. What is more, the survey expands it further with asking about the
recommendations the FinTech players give. The results of the survey on the challenge
is incorporated in the following chapters of this Report.

Predictability from the start of a

having a successful exit, remains
Recommendation 
#1 
within 
the
FinTech 
community 
in 
Bulgaria.
Undoubtedly, this could only happen
with 
a 
well-developed 
internal
market, highly efficient and effective
public institutions and an up-to-date
regulatory framework. 
2. Access to anonymised
data
TOP 3 TO
BOOSTING THE
ECOSYSTEM*
Being 
part 
of 
the 
440+ 
million
European Union market is both an
opportunity 
and 
a 
challenge.
Bulgarian FinTech companies remain
conservative about their place and
role 
on 
a 
global 
scale. 
More
internationalization 
initiatives 
are
needed, respondents say.
      - Policies and
regulation
Access to data has become a key
competitive driver which presents
new 
opportunities, 
especially 
for
FinTechs. Although in Bulgaria, as
shown above in the Mastercards&#x27; DPI,
the financial sectors&#x27; APIs are open
and running at almost 100%, 24/7,
data is still hard to be accessed.

2022 
has 
been 
a 
year 
of 
great
challenges and while it is easy to get
lost in the daily, it is also important to
acknowledge 
what 
we 
have
accomplished, 
reflect 
on 
it 
and
remind ourselves where we stand and
where we are headed. These are 3
trends by the public sector that aim to
develop the local ecosystem, improve
business conditions and build a better
home for the startups and ultimately
the people of Sofia.
Sandbox for Innovative Solutions
Innovative Sofia has a Swiss Army
knife of its own - the Sandbox for
Innovative Solutions. The Sandbox is a
municipal 
programme 
for 
pilot
projects 
that 
test 
innovative
technological 
solutions 
for 
urban
challenges, effectively making the city
an R&amp;D space for great ideas to turn
into scalable concepts. We strongly
believe 
that 
topics 
such 
as
environment, 
urban 
mobility, 
and
data gathering are most effectively
tackled together under the spirit of
cooperation and co-creation. Sofia has
a rich, strong and diverse startup
sector, so naturally, we should look
within the local ecosystem where
passion and ingenuity intersect and
 opt for a bottom-up approach in 
terms of project management. Since
the 
inception 
of 
the 
Sandbox,
Innovative Sofia has launched 9 pilot
projects, i.e. the Green Kindergarten
pilot, the VR Exhibition for Innovative
Schools, a wedding portal etc. 
With regards to fintech, the most
notable example would be the new e-
services 
platform 
for 
address
registration. Together with Evrotrust
Technologies 
JSC, 
we 
have
successfully digitally transformed the
legacy 
electronic 
service 
into 
a
modern, fully digital, fully online,
seamless e-service. The bridge that
made the transition from a paper
process made digital to a 360 degrees’
digital process was Evrotrust’s cloud-
based technology. The ease of use and
convenience not only saved users

thousands of hours, but also actively
encouraged and increased use of
municipal e-services over 30 times.
The address registration pilot is a case
study of how to satisfy a demand and
meet 
market 
expectations 
by
introducing human-centered design
to 
an 
outdated 
process, 
thus
establishing a new standard of service
offering 
that 
can 
be 
used 
as 
a
blueprint for future endeavors. 
What started as a pilot project for a
few select districts grew into a city-
wide solution with multiple phases of
scaling 
up, 
integration 
with 
the
Ministry of e-Governance, and more to
come in the future with a Phase 2.0
just around the corner, which is a
testament to how sandboxing is one
of the most effective method to
validate 
innovative 
concepts. 
We
would very much like to see more
regulatory sandboxes in the future,
especially ones aimed at the fintech
sector. 
Startup Visa
One 
of 
the 
most 
exciting 
new
developments for the ecosystem is the
startup visa, which launched in 
October. Thanks to the tireless efforts
by the Bulgarian Startup Association
(BESCO), there is now a mechanism in
place aimed at the startup sector that
fast-tracks long-term residence for
non-EU 
entrepreneurs 
and 
helps
founders &amp; entrepreneurs to make
Bulgaria their new home. Sofia has
already established itself as a tech &amp;
innovation hub, hence it stands to
benefit from an influx of innovators
that would ultimately help advance
the economy, create job opportunities
and impact the people. 
To 
apply 
for 
a 
startup, 
visa 
a
candidate must fill in an online form,
which is available in both Bulgarian
and English on the website of the
Ministry of Innovation &amp; Growth. The
form focuses on two aspects: 1) what
is your pitch deck and 2) how is your
concept innovative, which can be
supplemented 
with 
a 
patent 
or
competition awards. The application
is then reviewed by an expert advisory
board 
which 
comprises
representatives 
from 
the 
public
sector, academia, business, NGOs and
other 
members 
of 
the 
local
ecosystem, a process which should
take no longer than 30 days, unless
the 
application 
necessitates
additional documents. A successful
visa would then be valid up to 1 year,
which could potentially be extended
even further. 
The startup visa is an incredible

milestone, but for BESCO this is only
the beginning and there will be many
more great things to come. They are
already plans for a tech visa for digital
nomads, a practice that is becoming
more popular globally and in the EU,
the 
most 
recent 
example 
being
Portugal, which launched a tech visa
programme 
in 
October 
this 
year.
Furthermore, BESCO is working on
improving the procedure for Blue
Cards 
for 
IT 
talents, 
as 
well 
as
preparing 
other 
proposals 
for
amendments and policies that would
help to optimize the systems in place.
It is exciting to see what the future
holds and thanks to BESCO Bulgaria is
working its way towards achieving
Startup 
Nations 
Standard 
of
Excellence.
Compass for Entrepreneurs
How 
about 
a 
thought 
exercise?
Imagine for a second you want to start
a business here. You have the ideas,
the vision and you cannot wait to set
up shop. How familiar are you with
the local business landscape in terms
of 
finance 
opportunities,
administrative help and other relevant
insights? Of course, “Google is your 
friend” as the saying goes, but a far
more convenient option is to have a
one-stop for all such information
needs. This is where the Compass for
Entrepreneurs 
comes 
in, 
a 
joint
initiative by Innovative Sofia with
partners such as Invest Sofia, BESCO,
the Fund of Funds, VCs and other
financial institutions. 
Sofia 
has 
a 
growing 
economic
potential, 
capacity 
for 
innovation,
healthy conditions for business that
attract foreign interest. This is a
strong business environment with an
abundance 
of 
opportunities. 
This
wealth 
of 
information 
should 
be
made available, but more importantly,
made accessible to a wider audience,
so that they can in turn take that
information and create value out of it. 
The concept of the Compass for
Entrepreneurs is to gather all the
relevant 
information 
for 
new
businesses and consolidate it under a
single platform. Think of it as a
guiding tool for your entrepreneurial
journey 
that 
covers 
the 
entire
roadmap 
from 
the 
early
organizational stages through getting
financing and validation, to entering
the market and acquiring your first
clients.
While the Compass for Entrepreneurs
is 
still 
in 
its 
early 
stage 
of
development, we are confident that
providing an interactive technical

How 
can 
you 
ensure 
the 
top
performance, 
efficiency, 
and
happiness of employees?
Without 
a 
doubt, 
the 
working
environment plays a major role in all
these factors. Over the past couple of
years, 
the 
world 
discovered 
the
importance 
of 
flexibility 
at 
work.
Whether working from home or from
an office, the ability to shift gears
turned out to be paramount for
company success. But along with
flexibility, 
teamwork 
and
collaboration also need taking care of.
As an industry, fintech is no exception.

Enter the flex space. When Bulgarian
fintech startup Cashwave found their
new home at Entract 127, they were
looking for a place that would provide
their team with the social interactions
it needs to thrive. Thanks to its
location in the city centre of Sofia, this
exclusive flexible office space is easily
accessible 
while 
also 
ensuring
companies 
have 
a 
spacious 
and
collaborative setting. 
When you end up at a such a space,
you have the unique opportunity to
immerse in a new, bigger community
which includes other businesses and
individuals who value the networking
spirit 
of 
the 
flexible 
office
environment. 
Nevertheless, 
as 
the
official hub of the Bulgarian Fintech
Association, 
Entract 
127 
could
guarantee Cashwave connections with
other fintech businesses to exchange
tips and ideas.

As a fast-growing company with an

Cashwave started to gather their team
together every quarter. Entract 127
accommodates their needs as they
benefit from the private fitted out
office

coworking 
desks,
meeting rooms, 24/7 access, and the
multifunctional event space where
they organize in-person and hybrid

At the end of the day, you need an

All of this would not be possible

The Bulgarian Fintech Association
(BFA) is a non-governmental, for-
impact 
organisation 
uniting 
all
interested parties in the sector of
digital finance, working from the
region of Southeastern Europe (SEE).
Our mission is to bring together large
FinTechs, SMEs, supporting industries,
the 
respective 
authorities 
and
academia 
to 
create 
favourable
environment, including an innovative
regulatory framework, supporting the
development 
of 
digital 
finance
solutions. In 2019 BFA become one
the 
co-founders 
of 
the 
European
Digital 
Finance 
Association, 
the
largest 
FinTech 
organisation,
representing 15 European countries
and 
more 
than 
1,000 
FinTech
companies. 
In the similar vein, from the very first
days 
of 
its 
establishment, 
the
Bulgarian 
Fintech 
Association 
has
been 
the 
leading 
player 
in 
the
discussions for the development of
FinTech regulatory framework both
on national an supranational level.
The results
So far we have submitted more than a
couple of dozens of industry opinions
to the Bulgarian authorities on laws
and 
regulations 
relevant 
to 
our
industry such as the National Strategy
for Financial Literacy, Consumer 
 
Protection Law,  Bulgarian VAT law,
etc. and on an European level - Digital
Strategy 
for 
the 
EU, 
European
Measures to Support Digital Finance
in the Post-COVID-19 Context, PSD-2
Review, etc. 
What&#x27;s next 
At BFA, we clearly understand that
working on shaping EU and Bulgarian
regulation 
is 
a 
years-long, 
highly
complex 
process 
where 
positive
results could be achieved only with
the participation of numerous players,
both from the public and private
sector. BFA remains committed to the
SEE FinTech community and will
continue working towards achieving
the ecosystem&#x27;s goals.

Financial 
development 
and
innovation: The right path for a
sustainable 
future 
in 
the 
non-
banking financial sector
It 
is 
indisputable 
that 
new
technologies 
are 
fundamentally
reshaping the financial sector, while
at the same time they are significantly
facilitating the access of investors and
companies 
to 
services. 
Innovative
opportunities in the field of finance
are not new, hence in the recent years
the investment in technology and the
speed of development have reached
new heights. As a result, we are
witnessing the introduction of new
financial technology solutions that
use 
digital 
identification, 
mobile
applications, cloud services, big data
analytics, 
artificial 
intelligence,
blockchain 
and 
shared 
ledger
technologies. The Bulgarian Financial
Supervision 
Commission 
(FSC) 
is
guided by the belief that the rapid
and 
effective 
implementation 
of
financial 
innovations 
by 
capital
market participants supports both the
growth 
of 
their 
activity 
and 
the
development of the capital market as
a whole. Following this policy, the FSC
encourages  the growing interest in
the 
above 
principles 
and 
takes
consistent and timely actions for their
accelerated implementation in the
non-banking financial services sector.
One of the first steps in this direction
is the Innovation Hub created by FSC.
It provides a single point of contact 
for the provision of proposals, but also 
for the identification of obstacles that
are relevant to the sector and which,
through 
facilitated 
communication
and 
data 
exchange 
between 
the
interested parties and the regulator,
as 
in 
this 
way 
can 
shorten 
the
response time to inquiries received.
We are also committed to broadening
the dialogue with all of the interested
parties as a basis of achieving a
balance between the benefits of the
introduction of financial innovations,
and ensuring stability and confidence
in 
the 
financial 
markets 
and
protection of the rights of investors.
For this purpose, a special taskforce to
monitor financial innovations in the
non-banking 
financial 
sector 
was
created within the BFSC’s team. Its
activity is aiming at tracking the
benefits and controlling the risks
arising from the integration of

financial 
innovations, 
as 
well 
as
promoting the dialogue between the
regulator and the business. In this
connection the regular studies and
analyses that the Bulgarian Financial
Supervision Commission team carries
out in order to establish the level of
innovations 
used 
are 
of 
essential
importance. It must be noted that
such 
types 
of 
studies 
include 
a
specially developed methodology for
the 
effective 
extraction 
of
information, and the results of the
studies serve to plan the subsequent
and targeted actions.
At the same time, investor protection
is an important social responsibility –
and this also applies to the Bulgarian
Financial 
Supervision 
Commission.
The FSC undertakes a number of
actions aimed at facilitating users&#x27;
access 
to 
reliable 
and 
clear
information, so that they can protect
their rights. To achieve this goal, FSC
conducts a consistent educational
and information policy  - as part of it,
a &quot;Financial Innovations&quot; section has
been created on the FSC’s website. It
contains numerous publications of an
educational and cautionary nature
aimed at increasing the financial
literacy of all the users of financial
services. Also, we are about to present
the FSC Mobile application to the
public.
In this regard it, the FSC undertook
the next step to improve public
awareness and in accordance with 
new 
technologies. 
FSC 
launched
#InvestSafely, a digital campaign to
protect investors of financial services
in the non-banking financial sector. 
The campaign is a step forward from
the measures already taken by FSC for
the investors’ protection. Through the
provided online space, it is possible
for an unlimited number of people to
get information on how to distinguish
unauthorized 
firms 
and 
how 
to
protect 
oneself 
from 
them. 
The
campaign has a dedicated website
that combines video and text, news
and 
warnings 
to 
users:
https://investsafely.fsc.bg/, as well as
series of video content posted on the
FSC 
YouTube 
channel 
and 
FSC’s
LinkedIn 
profile. 
Additionally, 
the
users are provided with a direct
access 
to 
the 
list 
of 
licensed
investment 
firms, 
as 
well 
as
indications for investors to identify
irregularities. In addition to the above
actions, the initiative #InvestSafely
was also promoted through public
lectures conducted by some of the
FSC’s experts in partnership with the
Bulgarian 
Association 
of 
Licensed
Investment Brokers and the Investors
Compensation Fund, at the leading
universities 
in 
the 
Republic 
of
Bulgaria under the title “Invest Safely
in the Digital World”.
Convinced from the need for joint
cooperation between the regulator
and 
the 
business 
to 
create 
a
developed 
fintech 
ecosystem,
representatives of the Commission
actively participate in a number of
local and international initiatives in

cooperation 
with 
the 
Bulgarian
Fintech 
Association. 
One 
of 
the
examples in this direction is the
efficient and effective participation of
FSC in the events &quot;From Zero to
Fintech&quot; and the webinar &quot;Safety of
the digital financial instruments: Pay
safely 
on 
the 
Internet!&quot; 
which 
is
initiated by Junior Achievement and
organized by the Bulgarian Fintech
Association on the occasion of the
Global Money Week.
The FSC assesses the important role of
financial 
technologies 
for 
the
development of the capital market by
integrating digitization and changing
business models, through data-based
solutions, for example in the asset
management sector, in the sector of
investment intermediaries  and in the
distribution 
channels 
of 
financial
products. We are assured that the
communication with the European
supervisory 
authorities, 
the
participation in the meetings of the
structures 
of 
the 
European
Commission and the exchange of
experience with regulatory authorities
from 
other 
member 
states 
is 
of
primary 
importance 
for 
the
implementation 
of 
rules 
for 
the
development of digital technologies
in order the safety for investors to be
ensured. 
In this regard, the preparation of the
new Digital Financial Package of the
EC has also an important role for the
development of the digitization. The 
draft regulations and directives on
digital operational resilience for the
financial 
sector 
(DORA), 
on 
the
Markets 
in 
Crypto-assets 
and
amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937
(MiCA), the pilot regime for market
infrastructures based on distributed
ledger 
technology 
(DLT) 
are 
all
examples in this regard. The package
aims to stimulate competitiveness
and innovation in the financial sector
in Europe, to provide investors and
companies with a greater choice of
financial 
services 
and 
modern
payment solutions, and to ensure
investor 
protection 
and 
financial
stability. An essential stage in the
development 
of 
the 
regulatory
framework is the joint initiative of the
European supervisory authorities to
collect information and data with the
participation of the Commission and
representatives 
of 
the 
Bulgarian
companies, with the ultimate goal to
assist the market participants in the
future application of the European
legislation.
Furthermore, during 2022 the FSC
took part in online event organized by
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Lithuania
regarding 
the 
possibility 
of
introducing a regulatory sandbox - a
working environment provided by the
regulator for supervised testing of
new financial products and provision
of 
financial 
services 
in 
a 
digital
environment.
The 
crowdfunding 
regulation 
is
introduced in order to provide new
funding opportunities for start-ups
and small and medium-sized 
2

55


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 56"></div><pre class="text-content">
enterprises, which usually rely on
small-scale investments. Such funding
may be under the form of loans or
through 
the 
acquisition 
of
transferable 
securities 
or 
other
eligible instruments for the purposes
of crowdfunding. The adoption of the
new 
legal 
framework 
provides 
a
possibility to seek financing for their
activities by accessing the capital
markets of all EU member states
under alleviated conditions, while at
the same time equal conditions were
created 
for 
potential 
competitors
from other countries and the rights
and the interests of investors are
guaranteed. 
Regarding the investor protection, in
the legislation have been introduced
mechanisms, which are mainly in two
directions:
1. The first of them is aimed at
investors 
and 
more 
specifically 
it
addresses the need of preparing and
presenting an assessment to investors.
The 
aim 
is 
to 
confirm 
their
understanding of the risks involved in
investing 
in 
startups 
and 
private
enterprises.
2. 
The 
second 
group 
of 
investor
protection measures includes a set of
requirements 
for 
platforms,
encompassing 
conflict 
of 
interest
policies, 
prudential 
policies 
and
disclosure 
of 
information 
about
platforms wishing to invest in their
own offerings listed on the platform. It
is planned to prepare a new 
harmonized document for each offer -
an 
information 
sheet 
for 
key
investments 
(Key 
Investment
Information 
Sheet 
- 
KIIS). 
KIIS
includes information about project
creators 
and 
platform 
process
features. The new regulation allows
the use of special purpose vehicles
(SPVs), 
which 
facilitate 
individual
small investors and grant them the
same level of investor rights as larger
investors.
A guarantee for greater transparency
and competitiveness of companies on
the European market is provided by
the harmonized requirements and
rules, with the introduction of a single
process 
of 
authorization 
and
passporting for platforms that would
like to operate throughout Europe,
coordinated 
by 
the 
European
Securities 
and 
Markets 
Authority
(ESMA), as well as a uniform set of
requirements for businesses to raise
capital up to 5 million euros over a
period of 12 months without having to
prepare a prospectus.
In continuation of the actions already
taken and in sync with the adopted
Strategy 
for 
Monitoring 
Financial
Innovations for the period 2021-2024,
in 
which 
the 
planned 
long-term
commitments 
are 
outlined, 
FSC
declares its readiness to continue
successful 
cooperation 
with 
the
business. The FSC will continue to
promote the development of financial
innovations, 
by 
monitoring 
the
development 
of 
financial
technologies, assessing possible risks
for the market and for investors and

initiating actions and measures to
minimize them in order to realize the
benefits of the growing interest in
innovative 
financial 
products 
and
technologies, 
in 
accordance 
with
regulatory requirements.
The new technologies change the
non-banking financial sector and the
ways investors and companies access
services. They create opportunities for
better access to finance and improve
the financial inclusion of citizens
within the digital society. Financial
technologies 
support 
operational
efficiency and further increase the
competitiveness of the economy of
the countries where they are used and
contribute 
to 
the 
deepening 
and
expansion of capital markets in the
European Union.

FINTECH REGULATORY
LANDSCAPE
BULGARIA 2022
Where is Bulgaria located in terms of
regulation compared to the EU and
its neighbouring countries? 
The FinTech sector in Bulgaria has
been developing rapidly in recent
years. Bulgarian private and business
users 
are 
increasingly 
turning 
to
FinTech companies as an alternative
to banking services. This makes the
regulatory topic even more important,
since 
the 
legislative 
clarity 
and
consumer protection are obviously
paramount for the sustainability of
the whole FinTech ecosystem. Having
said this, Bulgaria has e high level of
compliance 
when 
it 
comes 
to
transposition 
of 
the 
relevant 
EU
financial regulations on local level,
where 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the
authorities remain conservative when
it 
comes 
to 
implementation 
of
entirely innovative (not established on
EU level) regulatory regimes in the
sphere.
According to BFA’s FinTech survey
2022, legislation remains to be the
biggest struggle to the FinTech SMEs
development. From your experience,
where 
are 
the 
most 
common
misunderstandings and obstacles?
The 
most 
common 
misunder-
standings and obstacles are related to
the cases where the activity of the
FinTech 
company 
falls 
on 
the
borderline 
between 
current
regulations for conventional financial
products and legislative gaps (grey
zones) 
where, 
basically, 
the
technology 
has 
outstripped 
the
development 
of 
the 
regulatory
framework. 
A good example in this regard is the
cryptocurrency field, where some of
the features of particular products are
on the one hand - very similar to
certain investment products, whereas
on the other – are truly unique and

non-regulated.
Is the market able to overcome
them? 
The market in the FinTech field is
always 
one 
step 
ahead 
of 
the
legislative basis and this is a direct
result of the fact that the whole sector
bases its growth on innovation. In
turn, 
this 
is 
a 
driving 
force 
for
evolution of the regulatory framework,
which 
is 
another 
positive
consequence 
of 
the 
technology
development in the field. Being able
to overcome challenges is one of the
reasons why FinTechs are FinTechs –
they always find a way to progress. 
What are the future steps, we might
see 
from 
policymakers 
and
regulators towards the improvement
of legislation in the country? What is
still missing in Bulgaria?
In our opinion, Bulgaria has to explore
the 
various 
opportunities 
for
development of the FinTech sector
through establishment of innovation
hubs and regulatory sandbox regimes.
These are places where FinTechs can
test their innovative products and
services, business models and delivery
mechanisms, so that consumers are 
 
protected and new financial products
and technologies are checked for
compliance 
with 
regulatory 
and
safety requirements.

The EU brings crypto-assets, crypto-
assets 
issuers 
and 
crypto-asset
service providers under a regulatory
framework for the first time. What
does this mean for the FinTech
industry of the EU?
MiCA in fact is not a product oriented
piece 
of 
regulation, 
it 
does 
not
regulate the crypto-assets themselves
but the crypto assets service providers
and 
the 
crypto 
asset 
issuers. 
It
therefore 
follows 
the 
standard
architecture 
of 
the 
EU 
financial
services 
legislation 
which 
is 
to
regulate 
the 
intermediaries 
of 
a
financial activity.
Having said that, the MiCA scope is
quite 
broad 
and 
provides 
a
comprehensive framework:
 -It covers the rights and obligations
applicable to issuers of crypto-assets
(separating crypto assets into three
main 
categories, 
asset 
referenced
tokens, 
e-money 
tokens 
and
everything else) and 
 -It covers the rights and obligations
applicable 
to 
crypto-asset 
service
providers (CASPs).
MiCA 
will 
bring 
a 
previously
unregulated space under financial
services regulation. The aim is to
promote the soundness of the entire 
crypto-asset market by rooting out
bad actors, providing consumer and
investor protection and setting the
necessary organisational, operational
and 
prudential 
requirements 
for
crypto-asset service providers, and
preventing market abuse. MiCA will
therefore provide legal certainty for
innovators and will allow them to
navigate 
financial 
legislation 
and
scale across the EU. 
In 
addition, 
MiCA 
implements
international recommendations from
the

Stability 
Board

also the Financial Action Task Force,
ensuring 
that 
together 
with 
the
updated AML framework all AML/CFT
risks are appropriately mitigated.
In short, MiCA will bring clarity, legal
certainty, protection for investors and
a framework for innovators to pursue
new digital finance ideas across the
EU.
What environmental safeguards will
be taken when implementing MiCA?
There are indeed concerns about the
environmental impact and increasing
energy needs of DLT, notably for
certain crypto-assets. 
As 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Commission’s
strategy for financing the transition to
a 
sustainable 
economy, 
the
Commission 
will 
assess 
the
sustainability impact of digital finance
technologies. We believe that the EU
should take the lead in making these
infrastructures climate neutral and
energy efficient by 2030. The EU
Taxonomy will be a key instrument to
ensure 
that 
the 
market 
uses
sustainable crypto-assets. This will 
build 
on 
previous 
initiatives 
to
promote sustainable data centres.
More 
concretely, 
MiCA 
already
recognises 
that 
the 
consensus
mechanisms used for the validation of
transactions in crypto-assets might
have principal adverse impacts on the
climate 
and 
other 
environment-
related 
impacts. 
Such 
consensus
mechanisms should therefore deploy
more 
environmentally-friendly
solutions 
and 
ensure 
that 
any
principal adverse impact that they
might have on the climate and any
other 
environment-related 
adverse
impact is adequately identified and
disclosed by issuers and crypto-asset
service providers. When determining
whether adverse effects are principal,
account 
should 
be 
taken 
of 
the
principle of proportionality and the
size and volume of the crypto-asset
issued. ESMA, in cooperation with
EBA, is mandated to develop draft
regulatory 
technical 
standards 
to
further 
specify 
the 
content,
methodologies and presentation of
information 
in 
relation 
to
sustainability indicators with regard
to climate and other environment‐
related 
adverse 
impacts, 
and 
to

When
developing 
the 
draft 
regulatory
technical 
standards, 
ESMA 
should
take into account the various types of
consensus mechanisms used for the
validation of transactions in crypto-
asset, their characteristics and the
differences 
between 
them. 
ESMA
should also take into account existing
disclosure 
requirements, 
ensure
complementarity 
and 
consistency,
and 
avoid 
double 
burden 
on
companies. 
In addition, the MiCA text provides for
a number of environmentally related
disclosures 
towards 
potential
investors:
 -The crypto asset white paper (for all
types of crypto assets) will need to
provide 
information 
on 
principal
adverse environmental and climate
related 
impact 
of 
the 
consensus
mechanism used to issue the crypto-
asset.
 -Crypto-asset service providers will be
required to make publicly available, in
a prominent place on their website,
information 
related 
to 
principal
adverse environmental and climate-
related impact of the consensus 
mechanism used to issue each crypto-
asset in relation to which they provide
services.
Finally, in the future MiCA review, the
Commission 
will 
examine 
the
developments in business models and
technologies 
in 
the 
crypto-asset
market with a particular focus on the
environmental and climate impact of
new 
technologies, 
as 
well 
as 
an
assessment of policy options and
where 
necessary 
any 
additional
measures that may be warranted to
mitigate the adverse impacts on the

and 
environment 
of 
the
technologies used in the crypto-assets
market and, in particular, of the
consensus

to
validate crypto-asset transactions.
What are the next steps?
Crypto-assets are an area of fast
innovation and developments. MiCA is
a 
beginning 
but 
does 
not 
cover
everything. There are areas falling out
of the scope of MiCA, for example
Decentralised Finance (DeFI) and this
is for good reason. This is an area still
in 
development, 
its 
risks 
and
vulnerabilities are monitored but have
not yet been fully assessed. That is

crypto industry and the clients across

States by way of a pan-European
passport to offer their services. Thus,
MiCA’s importance for the crypto-
asset industry is comparable to the
impact that the Markets in Financial
Instruments Directive (MiFID) had on
the financial instruments market, or
the 
one 
of 
the 
General 
Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the
protection of personal data in the EU. 
What will be the impact of MiCA on
the digital assets users in the EU?
Will it stimulate wider adoption of
digital currencies?
As a rule, the lack of regulation
exposes 
users 
to 
various 
risks,
facilitates unlawful and fraudulent
practices, 
and 
hinders 
the
development of a certain market.
Therefore, 
the 
natural 
result 
of
regulatory 
clarity 
in 
the
cryptocurrency field will be enhanced
security and protection for users, who
will be able to safely access new
investment 
opportunities 
or 
new
types of payment instruments and
services in a cross-border context. The
explicit 
requirements 
that 
MiCA
imposes on all industry players, 
EU CRYPTO
REGULATION
IMPACT ON PRIVATE
SECTOR
aiming to offer their products on the
EU market, including the rules on
market abuse, will undoubtedly have
a 
positive 
effect 
from 
a 
user
perspective. 
This 
will 
lead 
to 
an
increase of users’ trust in crypto assets
and their wider adoption as a means
of exchange and payment across the
EU.
Will MiCA attract more institutional
investors in the digital assets world?
Is this what the institutions expected
in order to recognize &amp; adopt digital
assets?
Regulatory clarity is always positive
when it comes to financial services. In
this sense, it is crucial to institutional
investors transacting in digital assets
of material value and volatile nature,
which can suffer significant financial
losses 
as 
a 
result 
of 
market
downturns, thus affecting financial
stability as a whole. A legislative
framework like MiCA will undoubtedly
boost the crypto industry credibility,
attracting only “reliable players” on
the side of operators, and create
greater comfort in relation to using
crypto-asset services in the EU. 
What obstacles do you expect the
companies 
to 
encounter 
when
implementing the regulation?

On one hand, MiCA is intended to
minimize the risk of “forum shopping”
between 
Member 
States, 
and
eliminate the fragmented regulatory
landscape, leading to confusion and
uneven treatment of multinational
market players across the EU. On the
other hand, all crypto-asset issuers
and service providers, who intend to
continue servicing the EU market,
have to consider the regulatory status
of 
their 
activities 
from 
MiCA’s
perspective. What is more, they need
to develop a complex strategy to
bring 
their 
operations 
into
compliance with the new rules, which
will undoubtedly be cost- and time-
consuming.
MiCA authorisation is associated with
structural, 
organizational, 
financial,
documentary, risk management and
even 
jurisdictional 
issues. 
The
preparatory actions to be undertaken
by the crypto companies in this
regard will depend on their size,
business strategy, and the type of
services for which authorization is
sought. Robust internal processes and
procedures need to be developed,
maintained and updated to ensure 
EU CRYPTO
REGULATION
IMPACT ON PRIVATE

compliance with the Regulation on an
ongoing basis. 
The new requirements could prove to
be a significant burden for smaller
crypto 
businesses 
that 
have 
not
allocated 
sufficient 
resources 
to
ensure compliance therewith, and for
third-country service providers. Thus,
both of these market players may be
deterred from entering the EU market.
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
overly 
strict
regulations of crypto activities could
result in suspending or limiting the
services offered by crypto companies
in the EU compared to those offered
in 
more 
innovation-tolerant
jurisdictions, and in increasing the
gap between them. This would reduce
both the companies&#x27; income from
such services and the EU users&#x27; access
thereto, 
thus 
having 
a 
negative
impact on crypto businesses.
What would be the MiCA impact on
the revenue of the crypto companies?
Taking into consideration the cost-
consuming compliance with MiCA
and the possibility of suspending,
limiting or restricting the provision of
relevant services to the EU market
until operations are brought into line
with 
the 
new 
requirements, 
the
revenue of crypto companies will be
negatively affected by the Regulation

compliance with the most demanding

enhance the AML/CTF measures and
ensure 
harmonization

coordination of supervisory practices
at a regional level, the EU intends to
also create a dedicated Anti-money

What is the future of regulations in

digital assets?
Every actively expanding, lucrative
and innovative industry such as the
crypto-asset one is related to the
continuous adoption of regulations
with the ultimate goal of ensuring
legal certainty, fair competition and
enhanced 
consumer 
and 
investor
protection. Being the first regional
comprehensive 
set 
of 
rules 
for
cryptocurrency 
operations, 
MiCA
serves as a competitive advantage of
the EU and lays the foundations of the
regulatory landscape worldwide.
As a global company at the forefront
of innovation, we are happy to see
regional 
and 
national 
lawmakers’
proactive interest in FinTech and

the highest industry standards and
the laws of all jurisdictions in which it

Having 
been 
proactive
regarding 
both 
local

global
regulations in the blockchain space,
we have always welcomed greater
transparency and legal certainty. In
this sense, MiCA will bring the much-
need regulatory clarity to the crypto
world, turning it into an overall safer
place for all market players.
Since the beginning of the legislative
endeavors around MiCA and the EU
Digital Finance Package, Nexo has
been 
applying 
a 
holistic 
EU
compliance approach and ensuring
the allocation of significant resources
for this purpose, all the while taking
into 
consideration 
the 
existing
fragmented 
regulatory 
landscape
across the Member States and the
forthcoming unified regulation at a
regional level. In preparation for the
adoption and entry into force of the
latter, which is a lengthy process, we

Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) and
the Travel Rule – industry impact and
Paysafe story
Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) is a
proposed regulation in EU law that
has already been endorsed by the
Economic 
and 
Monetary 
Affairs
Committee and the EU Council. It is
expected to be approved by the
European Parliament before the end
of 2022 and to enter into force at
some point in 2024. 
A key positive aspect of this law is to
introduce 
an 
EU-wide 
licensing
regime and enable a level playing
field for Crypto Asset Service Providers
(CASPs) who wish to access customers
in the whole region. A consistent
regulatory framework will increase
trust and will bring about stronger
institutional 
presence 
as 
well 
as
protection for retail investors, which
in turn will help develop the emerging
crypto industry.
This is especially positive for Paysafe
as we already work with many of the
key players in the industry who will
have an easier time of managing their
EU licensing strategy, as well as
enabling smoother onboarding for

smaller crypto players who are just
starting on their journey in the region.
Paysafe provides all these companies
with an easy and secure mechanism
for “on-ramps” (getting fiat money
into the crypto ecosystem) and “off-
ramps” (transferring crypto gains back
into the fiat system) as well as other
fiat-related services. 
In the broader crypto space, there is
often 
a 
reluctance 
to 
embrace
regulation, 
partially 
due 
to
cryptocurrencies’ cypherpunk origins.

all cross-border and domestic wire
transfer of funds. On 19 June 2019,
FATF extended Recommendation 16
to CASPs, including cryptocurrency
exchanges and wallet providers. The
aim is to address AML/CFT challenges
to help law enforcement agencies to
monitor and track criminal activities
where crypto-assets are used. Without
harmonised standards at a global
level, CASPs and financial institutions
face 
significant 
challenges 
in
developing 
compliant 
Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) solutions to comply
with the Travel Rule. Meeting these
regulatory 
obligations 
without
passing on the costs to consumers will
be challenging for the industry. The
Travel Rule presents a challenge, as
the underlying technology for crypto
is not designed to send personally
identifiable 
information 
alongside
transactions. There are several Travel
Rule solutions being produced and
CASPS may be faced with integrating
multiple protocols that are not all
interoperable. If there is not a globally
harmonised approach to compliance,
the cost could be extremely high.
When it comes to Bulgaria specifically,
the challenge will be to monitor the
speed of implementation of the new

The FinTech industry in the EU is
booming. 
However, 
many 
of 
the
FinTechs, especially the SMEs, face
obstacles to growing and offering
their 
services 
across 
the 
single
market. What are these difficulties
and 
how 
does 
the 
European
Commission help to overcome these
challenges?  
Fragmentation is indeed an issue in
Europe. “Classic” core activities in the
financial 
system 
are 
covered 
by
passporting. This means that any firm
authorised in an EU or European
Economic Area country on the basis of
common rules can offer financial
services or products across the Union.
But not all innovative new services
and applications fit neatly into this
system, and passporting does not
cover all areas of our rules. This can
make 
it 
prohibitively 
difficult 
for
firms, especially smaller ones, to scale
up their activities across the EU. This
hampers fintechs and means that
customers 
– 
both 
businesses 
and
consumers – are missing out on a
much bigger, more effective offering.
And 
on 
a 
broader 
level, 
this
fragmentation 
puts 
a 
brake 
on
innovation in the EU.
The European Commission is working
to 
overcome 
these 
challenges 
in
several ways. Legislation is one of
them. Our new framework for crypto  
assets 
for 
example 
will 
create
common rules enabling firms to scale
up across countries while protecting
investors and consumers. The new EU
Digital Finance Platform is another
tool. It is designed to build dialogue
between 
fintechs 
and 
national
financial 
supervisors 
and 
to 
offer
practical support for the scaling up of
digital financial services. Our central
feature in this context is a gateway to
supervisors: here, firms can find

And they can get into contact with
supervisory authorities here. 
What 
is 
the 
Digital 
Finance
Observatory? How about the cross-
border testing option the Platform
offers?
The Digital Finance Observatory is one
of two building blocks of the EU
Digital Finance Platform. It is all about
interaction. 
We 
are 
building 
a
European Fintech Map here – where
fintechs from across the EU can
literally put themselves on the map.
We hope that over time, this map will
show the evolving fintech ecosystem
in Europe and also enable firms to
build stronger connections with each
other. The Digital Finance Observatory
is also a place where users can share
events, 
hackathons 
and 
research
publications 
relevant 
for 
digital
finance. They can propose content
using webforms – a simple process
that 
allows 
fintechs 
to 
promote
activities and get in contact with
other companies and supervisors.
Cross-border testing is a core feature 
of the EU Digital Finance Platform.
Basically, the website offers a single
entry 
point 
for 
firms 
seeking 
to
involve multiple national supervisors
when they have a new product or
application that they want to offer in
specific countries. Via a standardised
form, 
firms 
can 
contact 
various
national 
supervisors 
in 
one 
step.
These 
supervisors 
can 
act 
as
regulatory 
sandbox, 
observers 
of
testing or recipient of test findings.
Testing will still take place at the
national level, according to national
rules. But cross-border testing is an
important step towards simplifying
the process for fintechs and fostering
closer cooperation between national
supervisors. The rules underpinning
cross-border testing were developed
by national competent authorities,
coordinated 
by 
the 
European
Supervisory Authorities, and we are
proud to give this initiative a home on
the EU Digital Finance Platform.
How can a FinTech company be part
of the European FinTech Map? 
It is really easy! All it takes is one click
on a button that says “Add your
company”, enter a few details about
your business, such as your sector and
activity, and press “Save”. Our EU
Digital Finance Platform team will
then see the form and publish it

(possibly after getting back to you
with questions if something is not
clear). The map is open to all fintechs
licensed 
in 
an 
EU 
or 
European
Economic Area country. 
What are the future steps of the EU
Digital Finance Platform? 
We are busy preparing the second
phase of this project. The key novelty
we are planning to build is a Data
hub. This would complement national
innovation hubs and sandboxes, as
well as cross-border testing. The idea
is to make data available to firms here
that they can use to test innovative
products – data that is not normally
available to them. At least initially, we
plan to build the Data hub with
synthetic data. This would help to get
around confidentiality requirements
that make sharing data very difficult.
The Commission will offer national
supervisors, 
but 
also 
market
participants 
the 
possibility 
to
synthesise relevant data with the help
of a private provider, whose services
would be acquired centrally by the
Commission. We are looking forward
to discussing this in more detail with
fintechs – your feedback is essential to
make sure we offer data for testing
that is useful and relevant.

FINTECH EDUCATION
IN BULGARIA - 2022
For a third consecutive year FEBA at
Sofia 
University 
“St. 
Kliment
Ohridski” and in collaboration with
BFA, launched a Master’s degree in
Finance, Investments, and FinTech.
Tell us more about the programme?
First of all, we are very grateful to the
Bulgarian Fintech Association for the
valuable partnership and constant
support and we look forward to
continue 
and 
expand 
our
collaboration in the future! 
Our 
Master’s 
degree 
in 
Finance,
Investments 
and 
FinTech 
is
interdisciplinary in nature and aims to
give 
students 
theoretical 
and
practical knowledge and skills in the
field 
of 
finance, 
investments 
and
financial innovation. It combines the
fields of company’s financial analysis
with 
financial 
instruments,
investments and fintech.
The 
programme 
starts 
with
introductory courses on investment
management and FOREX, which cover
topics 
of 
the 
essence 
and
infrastructure of financial instruments
and markets. Some of the key courses
are devoted to business valuation,
financial technology and electronic
banking, 
crypto-assets, 
alternative
investments etc.
How is this year’s programme

different from last year&#x27;s? What do
you want to continue doing and
where you could go better? 
What is different is that we have
increased the horary in disciplines
such as Alternative Investments, we
have 
added 
exercises 
in 
Applied
Macroeconomic 
Analysis, 
we 
have
optimized 
the

FINTECH EDUCATION
IN BULGARIA - 2022
We constantly strive to keep up with
changes, consider modern trends and
update the curriculum in a timely
manner. The presence of a blockchain
and 
cryptocurrency 
course 
at 
a
Bulgarian university is a pleasant
surprise for the business. We foresee
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
specialized
practical 
course 
in 
the 
field 
of
regulations in the fintech industry, as
well as further changes to enrich the
curriculum of the programme.
What’s the student’s and company’s
feedback and how do you plan to
increase 
the 
impact 
of 
the
programme?
We constantly seek feedback from our
students in order to improve. We get a
lot of positive feedback and we highly
appreciate 
it 
together 
with 
the
criticism which help us get better at
what we do. The interest of the
business towards our programme is
also 
high 
considering 
the 
large
number of guest lectures on fintech
and 
e-banking, 
cryptocurrencies,
alternative 
investments 
and 
many
more. For a third year in a row the
master’s degree programme is among
the 
most 
desirable 
in 
FEBA 
and
maintains a steady enrollment of over
40 students per year. This gives us the
motivation to constantly upgrade and
improve our programme. The positive
word-of-mouth feedback is very

incentive is to offer valuable and
contemporary 
education 
on 
a
Master`s level in Bulgaria. The same
goal we follow with the Bachelor`s
programme in Accounting, Finance
and Digital Applications in English,
which is the first and only accredited

VUZF launches a Master’s degree
programme in FinTech, finance and
digital innovation in partnership with
BFA. What is new in this programme
and how would the students benefit
from the BFA participation in it?
We are happy to launch the first
master&#x27;s 
programme 
in 
FinTech,
Finance 
and 
Digital 
Innovation,
although similar programs already
exist in other universities. We believe
we have designed a program to
respond 
to 
the 
most 
immediate
demands of the market for digital
innovation in the field of finance. This
ambitious project aims to prepare
highly qualified professionals, who
will work in financial as well as non-
financial institutions. Digitalization is
a must and no future profession can
go without it. Meanwhile, we are
privileged to have as our partner the
BFA in this joint venture. We highly
value 
their 
contribution 
to 
the
programme as guest lecturers and
their 
engagement 
in 
the 
overall
education process. It is a common
mission we have set as partners - to
design a modern program and to give
our students not only theoretical but
also 
practical 
knowledge 
and
experience. 
What are the main topics covered by
the programme and how would the 
best FinTech master’s degree

FinTech 
and
open banking, risk capital and private
investments, Fintech and insurance
(InsurTech), Regtech and Suptech,

working in the field of finance or
pursuing a career in this field. It is not
necessary to be a person with a
bachelor’s 
degree 
in 
Finance 
or
Economics. 
We 
also 
offer 
the
programme for people with other
academic backgrounds, in different
fields such as law, humanities, etc.
They will go through a preparatory
year 
and 
cover 
the 
fundamental
disciplines in economics, while in
their 
second 
year 
they 
will 
be
specialising 
in 
particular 
FinTech
courses. 
What are the plans for the future
extension of the programme?
We intend to invite guest lecturers
from leading foreign universities, who
will contribute to the programme. In
addition, we are planning to organise
round 
tables 
and 
seminars 
with
FinTech 
companies 
with 
the
participation of the students and also
study visits in the companies to give
our students a first hand impression
of how it all happens in practice. Once
we build up an alumni network, it
would be great if we can establish a
connection between our graduate and
current students and organise peer-
to-peer seminars and workshops on
different topics. In addition, we are
also

VISSARION KARVOUNIS
FOUNDER 
AND 
CEO 
OF
STREAMFLOW
Our story in Bulgaria
Streamflow started its operations in
2014 
as 
an 
“EOOD” 
with 
just 
1
employee and 1000€ worth of capital
at small office next to blvd. Bulgaria.
Two years later, Streamflow entered
the FinTech sector and in 2020 due to
its increased turnover became an
“EAD”. Nowadays Streamflow has 12
employees, operates offices in three
more 
countries 
through 
its
subsidiaries, 
has 
over 
140.000
accounts, 
6 
White 
Labels 
and 
a
turnover exceeding EUR 885 million
without counting the turnover of the
partner White Labels, showcasing the
potential of the FinTech market in
both Bulgaria and Europe.
Why Bulgaria?
People tend to believe that Bulgaria is
a cheap business destination. While
Bulgaria is a cost-effective destination
to operate a business in, it does not
mean that there is any compromise in
the quality of the business ecosystem.  
I literally cannot stress enough how
the Bulgarian business ecosystem is
characterized by quality where one of
the key factors stimulating economic
growth is its human capital. A highly-
skilled workforce along with a focus
on 
tech 
education, 
provide 
the
FinTech industry a pool of talented
individuals that can help them grow. 
However, the potential of the growth
of the private sector in Bulgaria, 
WHY BULGARIA?
INDUSTRY VIEW
including ours, is limited by the
brain-drain which translates to loss
of human capital. That is why I
strongly 
believe 
that 
we 
as 
an
Association 
and 
as 
businesses
operating in Bulgaria should partner
with other actors for a long-term
initiatives and plan aiming for the
repatriation 
of 
the 
Bulgarian
diaspora. 
And 
that 
is 
how 
the
Bulgarian business ecosystem will
reach its full potential. 
About Streamflow
We are a FinTech company with EMD
agent 
licenses, 
a 
programme
manager, operates its own platform
and at the same time offers White
Label solutions for other businesses
that are not necessarily FinTech.

How is the P2P business developing
in 
Bulgaria, 
is 
it 
gaining 
more
traction and popularity?
More 
and 
more 
Bulgarians 
add
investments in the so-called P2P loans
to their investment portfolio. They aim
to 
diversify 
with 
moderate 
and
modern products. 
On the one hand, they want to escape
from the unsatisfyingly low-interest
rates of the banks and at the same
time to get more predictability and
security compared to more volatile
options such as investments in stocks
or cryptocurrencies. An interesting
fact is that the majority of Bulgarians
who chose P2P lending for their
wallet first started with iuvo. This does
not surprise us, considering that iuvo
is the first Bulgarian P2P platform for
investing in loans and we are the
leader of the local market.
What are the advantages of doing
P2P business in Bulgaria?
Earlier 
this 
year, 
we 
started 
the
process of moving iuvo registration to
Bulgaria. Our country is one of the
main IT outsourcing hubs in Europe,
and it offers excellent prospects for
FinTech companies. With the move
back 
home, 
we 
will 
significantly
reduce platform maintenance costs
and with the saved resources we will
invest in more innovation for our
platform.

IUVO GROUP
What business goals do iuvo set for
the Bulgarian market?
We aim to continue to be a leader
among Bulgarian P2P platforms, as
well as to be in the top 3 throughout
Europe. We understand perfectly that
there is a significant part of Bulgarian
society who are still conservative and
is 
not 
familiar 
with 
alternative
instruments for their savings. Some of
these people still keep their savings in
the banks at close to 0% interest rate. 
We want to reach these users and give
them a safe alternative - iuvoSAVE.
This product offers a fixed period for
their 
investment, 
flexibility, 
and
liquidity. Ultimately, this product

with 
the
predictability of their cashflows and
the ability to know exactly when and
what amount to expect. What is more,
with iuvoSAVE it is possible to deposit
additional funds or withdraw early for
a small fee, but without changing the
end 
date 
and 
without 
losing 
all
interest.
What is your plan for being part of
the Bulgarian FinTech ecosystem? 
As co-founders of Bulgarian fintech

of 
the

the
ecosystem.

On 14 July 2021, the ECB decided to
launch the investigation phase of the
digital euro project. What is the
digital euro and why do we need it? 
Digitalisation and new technologies
are increasingly shaping European
citizens’ 
lives 
and 
the 
European
economy. 
With 
the 
European
economy becoming more and more
digital, Europeans also increasingly
use digital means of payment to
transact. The socio-economic impacts
of the COVID-19 crisis accelerated this
trend and increased the need to allow
the 
business 
to 
be 
conducted
remotely 
and 
through 
innovative
digital 
technologies, 
wherever
possible.
 
In March 2021, the Eurosummit called
for a stronger and more innovative
digital 
finance 
sector 
and 
more
efficient 
and 
resilient 
payment
systems. In this context, it was stated
that exploratory work on the possible
introduction of a digital euro should
be taken forward.
The 
Digital 
Finance 
and 
Retail
Payment 
Strategies 
of 
the
Commission adopted in September
2020 supported the emergence of
competitive home-grown and pan-
European 
payment 
solutions
supporting Europe’s economic and
financial sovereignty and supported
the exploration of a digital euro.
FINTECH
TECHNOLOGIES 
DIGITAL EURO
The ECB’s retail payment strategy
also calls for European payment
solutions that have a pan-European
reach, are low cost, are safe and
efficient, are European brand and
governance and can be globally
accepted in the long run. The ECB
issued its report on the digital euro
in October 2020 and ran a public
consultation on the digital euro
between October 2020 and January
2021. 
On 14 July 2021, the Governing
Council of the ECB decided to kick-
start a formal investigation phase on

the digital euro in October 2021.
Overall, the entire process leading to
the possible issuance of the digital
euro is expected to last 5 years and
aims 
at 
addressing 
key 
issues
regarding 
use 
cases, 
design 
and
distribution. 
Following 
the 
ECB
decision, the Eurogroup has engaged
in a series of discussions on the
objectives and use cases and policy
implications. 
The possibility to introduce a retail
digital euro has received support from
the European Parliament and the
Eurosummit. 
What would a digital euro be?
The idea of retail Central Bank Digital
Currencies 
(CBDC) 
has 
gained
significant attention over recent years.
A retail CBDC, like cash, would be an
official form of currency constituting a
direct central bank liability towards
its holder in digital form. A retail
CBDC makes central bank digital
money available to the general public
(i.e. businesses and people), in the
same way as cash is available to the
general public as a direct claim on the
central bank.
FINTECH
TECHNOLOGIES 
DIGITAL EURO
In the euro area, the establishment
of a retail CBDC – a digital euro –
could support a stronger and more
innovative digital finance sector and
more efficient and resilient payment
systems. A digital euro could play a
role 
in 
further 
enhancing
competition and innovation in the
European retail payments market by
facilitating the development of a full
range of pan-euro area end-user
solutions accessible to consumers as
well as supporting digital financial
services.
How is the European Commission
involved 
in 
its 
creation 
and
implementation?
The European Commission will do a
legislative proposal (regulation). The
regulation based on Art 133 TFEU
would establish the Digital Euro and
regulate its essential elements. It
would then be up to the ECB to
decide whether to issue a Digital
Euro. 
The 
process 
will 
be 
the
following:
The ECB process
The digital euro project is a project
for a retail (a.k.a “general purpose”,
i.e. for people and businesses) CBDC
(Central Bank Digital Currency). In
the investigation phase, the ECB will
focus on design decisions supported
by market research (esp. focus 
2
Be part of the movement at fintechbulgaria.org
87


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 88"></div><pre class="text-content">
groups) 
but 
no 
further 
detailed
technical 
experimentation 
are
foreseen. 
Final decision on technical design is
expected for Q1 2024. If the ECB
decides to issue a digital euro, the
development phase would likely last
two more years.
The ECB is thinking to go with a first
release of the digital euro, followed by
additional releases with additional
(innovative) functionalities (staggered
approach).
The legislative process
The issuance of a digital euro will
require a regulation under Article 133.
To fit ideally within the timeline
resulting from Eurogroup discussions
and the ECB investigation phase, the
proposal for a regulation should be
ready 
in 
Q1 
2023. 
In 
addition,
legislative 
action 
would 
also 
be
necessary to introduce the digital
euro in existing sectoral legislative
acts and coordinate them.
The Council and the Parliament of the
EU should ideally adopt the
FINTECH
TECHNOLOGIES 
DIGITAL EURO
Regulation by the end of 2023.
What is the role of public and
private sector in the digital euro
ecosystem?
In a digitalised economy, a digital
euro is meant to meet new payment
needs of citizens and businesses.
Industry 4.0 and the crypto-assets
ecosystem are fast evolving. There is
growing demand for new forms of
payments. Cash cannot respond to
the 
needs 
of 
Industry 
4.0,
decentralised finance (DeFi) or the
decentralised 
internet 
(web 
3),
which demand a new, state-of-the-
art payment ecosystem. Compared
to crypto assets and stablecoins, a
digital euro would provide added
value given its risk free nature. 
The Commission would support use
cases of the digital euro where
private solutions cannot or do not
fulfil users’ needs due to lack of
profitability, 
business 
interest 
or
technological 
or 
regulatory
limitations. 
These 
include 
micro
payments, 
off-line 
payments 
and
work 
on 
programmable 
and
machine-to-machine payment. 
At the same time, the digital euro
should not crowd out private 
2

88


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 89"></div><pre class="text-content">
Financial stability risks, as it
may result in large scale shifts
of deposits from commercial
banks to the digital euro, if not
prudently designed; 
Risks 
to 
crowding 
out 
the
private sector, if synergies are
not adequately developed. 
The digital euro involves key
political, industrial and societal
choices. And this needs to be
debated further as well. 
We 
are 
calling 
upon 
all
interested parties to participate
in the various outreach 
possibilities 
including 
our
targeted public consultation. 
On that basis, we will prepare
the legislative proposal we plan 
solutions. 
This 
is 
why 
solutions
developed for the digital euro need to
work 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
other
initiatives such as instant payments
deployment 
and 
the 
European
Payment 
Initiative 
(EPI). 
Synergies
with 
the 
digital 
euro 
can 
be
developed along a shared acceptance
infrastructure 
in 
terms 
of 
POS
terminals and standards.
What to expect in the near future?
To conclude, we believe that the
digital 
euro 
would 
provide 
clear
benefits for business and citizens.
·It also carries however some risks:

FUTURE OF FINTECH
TECHNOLOGIES 
INDUSTRY VIEW
We have seen great developments in
digital payments, but it seems that
&quot;cash&quot; is still king?
There is one main reason for this, and
that is the apparent notion that
paying in cash is free. When we
exchange cash, there are usually no
fees. But at the same time, everyone
has a smartphone because it&#x27;s easier
and cheaper to communicate that
way. And this is where the paradox
comes 
in: 
We 
all 
communicate
digitally, but prefer to pay cash.
However, 
payment 
is 
a 
form 
of
communication. So we&#x27;re trying to
bring it into the environment where
people communicate. And we do it in
an accessible and cost-effective way. I
can tell you about our project with
Rakuten Viber - EasyPay&#x27;s chatbot for
paying utility bills, where we already
have almost 350,000 users. One can
also just check the bills for free.
We saw your recent campaign to cut
back on paper at the expense of
digital receipts. Is that the other big
&quot;enemy&quot; of digitization: paper?
For 
historical 
reasons, 
paper 
is
enshrined 
in 
some 
laws 
as 
an
evidentiary document between two
parties. 
Whether 
it 
is 
a 
utility,
insurance, or financial contract... The
main function of this document is to 
serve as evidence to a third party
when 
needed. 
The 
signature
confirms the authenticity of the
document. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
put 
a
signature on a piece of paper. But
only so much. Everything else that
involves paper, such as production,
storage 
and 
data 
collection, 
is
expensive and difficult. That&#x27;s why
we developed a document signing
service 
for 
EasyPay&#x27;s 
offices 
in
collaboration with InfoNotary. The
provider sends the customer a

FUTURE OF FINTECH
TECHNOLOGIES 
INDUSTRY VIEW
Super Apps have been on the rise for
some time now and in certain regions
of the world have become a default
way of consuming a wide variety of
experiences and services. What does
it mean for the fintech sector?
First, let’s start with the Super App
definition. Every day we use more
than 10 different mobile applications -
from 
banking 
to 
socializing 
and
shopping. Imagine doing all this in
just one app. By bringing together a
range of experiences, services, and
functions on a single platform that
customers 
already 
feel 
confident
using, Super Apps provide seamless
experiences that keep users engaged.
Since 
embedded 
payments 
and
financial services are among the most
common features of Super Apps, I
would say that fintech is what glues
things together. You have all your
money management options in one
place and on top of that, you can shop
online, book accommodation, or buy
tickets 
without 
leaving 
the 
app.
Fintech 
is 
already 
remodeling
financial 
services, 
and 
now 
it’s
changing the way we use digital
services in general.
What are the key reasons for Super
Apps success? 
The 
biggest 
reason 
is 
the
convenience that people are always
searching for. A one-stop platform
for multiple tasks saves time and
sweeps 
the 
troubles 
of 
creating
several accounts and remembering
numerous passwords. Many people
are facing issues with storage on
their devices because various apps
were downloaded. Not to mention
the uncontrolled increase in the
number of applications over the
years. App stores are like a never-
ending pit, and it is very difficult for
the 
user 
to 
find 
the 
reliable
application they need in this chaos.

FUTURE OF FINTECH
TECHNOLOGIES 
INDUSTRY VIEW
In addition to the convenience of a
single login, Super Apps also reduce
the risk of compromised user data.
They store all personal and financial
information 
in 
one 
ecosystem 
of
products and services, as opposed to
spreading across multiple platforms.
But even then, information security is
of paramount importance. Hence, we
as users need to stay alert when it
comes to data security and use only
reliable 
platforms 
with 
a 
strong
authentication process.
The benefit of keeping users’ data is
the personalization of the consumer
experience. Super Apps make it easy
to capture customer information so
merchants can serve them offers more
relevant to their interests. Like loyalty
programs, 
coupons, 
or 
discounts
based 
on 
their 
preferences.
Furthermore, consumers get access to
a vast range of services, even some
new to them. 
In 2021 Paysera announced that the
mobile wallet will transform into
Super App. Why did you decide to
take this road and what is your value
proposition?
Paysera is much more than a digital 
payment 
platform. 
We 
work 
in
synergy with our partners to create a
fintech hub around our core services.
In addition to payments, we offer
also 
the 
possibility 
to 
buy
investment gold online, access to
loans, 
ticket 
sales, 
and 
even
donations to charity. Paysera clients
can invest in agricultural loans and
real 
estate 
through 
leading
crowdfunding 
platforms. 
The
process 
is 
fast 
and 
convenient,
directly via their smartphone or
through a simplified identification
procedure. By linking their Paysera
account 
to 
the 
wallet 
in 
the
platform, 
clients 
can 
track 
all
movements in real-time.
Our 
path 
to 
the 
transformation
began a long time ago with the
Paysera mobile wallet and the 360-
degree 
payment 
account. 
We
adopted 
the 
client-centered
approach and gradually added new
services and features. The results
today 
- 
a 
complete 
transaction
service 
with 
easier 
and 
more
accessible 
digital 
payments 
that
help businesses be more competitive
and 
effective 
in 
their 
financial
management. 
What other services or features do
you plan to add and how do you
keep your clients engaged through
the changes?

We do the changes gradually. Firstly,
each new integration requires lots of
IT development work. And secondly,
to give more time to our clients to
accept and get used to the new
things. Our long-term plans are to
provide a complete ecosystem of
services 
shaped 
around 
users’
everyday 
lifestyle 
needs. 
It 
is
incorporated in our slogan - “One app,
endless possibilities”. Shopping, more
investment options, and virtual cards
are some of the new solutions we are
working on.
However, it takes time to define and
transform the client’s needs into a
new feature. Our team examines and
analyzes customers’ preferences first.
Only after that, we consider new
partnerships. 
We 
have 
already
received 
requests 
from 
several
digitally 
oriented 
companies 
that
want to integrate their service into
Paysera Super App. 
What does the future of Super Apps
look like?
Although Super Apps began in Asia, 
they are quickly becoming a common
trend 
globally. 
Billions 
of 
users
experience the convenience of having
multiple services within one app and
local businesses gain better exposure.
 In my opinion, the more often that
customers use them, the greater
their benefits will be in this digital
interface. 
Regardless of what they’re called
and how they’ll be developed, Super
Apps will have a significant impact
on open banking implementation
too. 
As 
the 
digital 
landscape
continues to evolve, competition for
consumers&#x27; attention is also growing.
Mobile applications already started
adapting to users’ financial habits
and improving the user experience.
All of this is possible thanks to open
banking.

Main terminology and definitions 
FinTech firms are enterprises whose core business is related to the creation or use of
technologies, enabling innovations, and facilitating the supply, access, and/or usage of financial
or insurance services, including technologies in payments, money transfer, insurance, digital
lending, personal finance and savings, digital banking, investing, debt collection, accounting,
capital markets, credit scores and analytics, mobile wallets, and payroll and benefits. In 2022, we
have identified a total of 156 companies operating in the FinTech industry in Bulgaria. They were
collected through desktop research from various sources, including the Commercial Register,
part of the Registry Agency of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Register of non-profit legal
entities, Crunchbase, Dev.bg, news portals, BFA, and external databases. We estimate that the
companies included in the report represent more than 95% of all Fintechs operating in Bulgaria,
which provides reliable, comparable, comprehensive and independent data about the market
stakeholders. 
For the analysis of the industry, we applied the Taxonomy of FinTech of the Centre for Alternative
Finance at the University of Cambridge University. Following this taxonomy, we divided FinTech
business models and therefore all FinTech companies into 13th categories, which cover the whole
range of products and services developed by the companies in the industry:
