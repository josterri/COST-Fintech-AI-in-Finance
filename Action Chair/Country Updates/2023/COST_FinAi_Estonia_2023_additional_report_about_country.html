1. PREFACE
Two years have passed since the last report on the Estonian FinTech sector was prepared (for reference 
see Laidroo, et al., 2021b). Over the years, the Estonian FinTech sector has been characterised by speedy 
development both locally and globally (Laidroo and Avarmaa, 2020; Laidroo et al., 2021a; Tirmaste et al., 
2019). The COVID-19 outbreak created some challenges inside the companies while creating opportunities 
outside. Still, its overall impact on Estonian FinTechs remained modest (Laidroo, et al., 2021b). Geopolitical 
developments following the break-out of the war between Russia and Ukraine in February 2022 have 
increased uncertainties and left a significant mark on the regional economic conditions, impacting the 
everyday activities of most businesses. The startup sector has been further touched by the global decline 
in the availability of funding.  
This report aims to provide an overview of the recent developments influencing the Estonian FinTech 
sector and the main characteristics and challenges of the FinTechs. This report is prepared in cooperation 
between TalTech School of Business and Governance and FinanceEstonia, which is a non-profit 
organisation representing the financial sector. As mapping the FinTech landscape is a challenge, because 
of the difficulties in distinguishing FinTechs from non-FinTechs, we would urge the Estonian FinTechs not 
mentioned in this report to let us know of their existence, so they can provide input for future reports. 
The report is divided into several sections. Section 2 provides the definitions and the overall framework of 
the report. Section 3 presents an overview of the current Estonian FinTech environment with the main 
focus on changes in the legal environment and regulatory sandbox approach in Estonia. Section 4 presents 
an overview of Estonian FinTechs and the results of the survey conducted in spring 2023. Section 5 
concludes the report by presenting the most important findings. 
We greatly appreciate the support provided by the FinanceEstonia FinTech workgroup in contacting the 
FinTechs, and by the FinTechs who participated in the survey. We would like to thank Andrus Alber, Anu 
Müürsepp, Kristen Leppik, Thomas Auväärt, Siiri Tõniste, Kristiina Kubja for their input and feedback on 
this report. We acknowledge the contribution of Bruno Isand, Hedi Radtšenko, Kristiina Pullerits, Mari 
Avarmaa in preparing this report. We would like to thank our colleagues Thomas Ankenbrand, Andreas 
Dietrich, and Denis Bieri from the Lucerne School of Business for igniting our interest in preparing a FinTech 
report. We also appreciate the financial support from Tallinn University of Technology under the grant 
BHV1 “Digital Development in Finance” which has allowed us to finance the preparation of this report as 
well as Estonian Research Council grant PRG1125 that enabled us to investigate the aspects related to 
regulatory sandbox. We also value the moral support from colleagues involved in COST Action CA19130 – 
Fintech and Artificial Intelligence in Finance – Towards a transparent financial industry (FinAI).

2. DEFINITION AND FRAMEWORK OF THE STUDY
2.1. Definition of FinTech 
There are numerous definitions of FinTech but no 
consensus about which is the most appropriate. 
In the 2023 report, we rely on the definition by 
EBA (2017) p.4: “technologically enabled 
financial innovation that could result in new 
business models, applications, processes or 
products with an associated material effect on 
financial markets and institutions and the 
provision of financial services”. This means that 
this report continues to cover both startups and 
established firms involved in or supporting the 
provision of financial services. To be included in 
the report, the FinTech companies had to be 
incorporated in Estonia meaning that we are 
omitting all branches (e.g., Wise, Monese). 
 
To capture the developments in the FinTech 
sector more accurately, this report relies on a 
categorisation similar to the one introduced in 
CCAF, World Bank and World Economic Forum 
(2022). The latter report divides FinTechs into 
two broad categories – retail facing and market 
provisioning – which we treat in this report as 
providers of financial services and providers of 
technology and support services. 
 
Providers 
of 
financial 
services 
include 
companies involved in: 
• 
Digital lending – P2P lending, balance 
sheet lending, including invoice trading, 
leasing, consumer credit. 
• 
Digital capital raising – equity-based, 
revenue/profit 
share, 
reward-based, 
donation-based 
crowdfunding, 
real-
estate crowdfunding, ICO platforms. 
• 
Digital banking – fully digital banks, 
providers of banking as a service (BaaS) 
that have obtained a banking licence. 
• 
Digital savings – digital savings solutions, 
savings-as-a-service. 
• 
Digital payments – mobile payments, 
money 
transfers, 
e-money 
issuers, 
points of access, other payment-related 
services. 
• 
Digital asset exchange – trading and 
brokerage services including different 
platforms, exchanges, Bitcoin Teller 
Machines etc. 
• 
Digital custody - digital wallets, key 
management services. 
• 
WealthTech – robo-advisors, social 
trading, personal financial management, 
financial comparison sites.  
• 
InsurTech – insurance-related products 
and services, including digital brokers or 
agents, 
peer-to-peer 
insurance, 
insurance comparison portals etc. 
 
Providers of technology and support services 
include: 
• 
Alternative credit &amp; data analytics – 
credit scoring based on alternative data, 
solutions based on analysis of biometric 
and social data. 
• 
RegTech 
– 
solutions 
for 
meeting 
regulatory 
requirements, 
including 
profiling 
and 
due 
diligence, 
risk 
analytics, regulatory reporting, market 
monitoring etc. 
• 
Digital identity – services related to 
biometric 
security, 
KYC, 
fraud 
prevention. 
• 
Enterprise technology provisioning – 
technological solutions for financial 
service providers including back-office 
solutions, 
API 
management, 
cloud 
computing, AI, BI tools, enterprise 
blockchain etc. 
 
Compared to the initial categorisations by CCAF, 
World Bank and World Economic Forum (2022), 
we exclude providers of digital accounting 
solutions as these are not specifically targeted at 
providers of financial services. Also, our 
interpretation of some of the sub-categories 
includes some modifications. All companies 
covered by this report had to fall into one of the 
sub-categories which we initially determined in 
the course of desk research based on public data 
in different registries and companies’ web pages. 
For those companies that responded to the 
survey, 
we 
cross-checked 
the 
initial 
categorisations based on the responses.

The above-mentioned categorisation is similar to 
the one used in FinTech Report Estonia 2021 and 
differs from the one used in FinTech Report 
Estonia 2019, which relied on IFZ FinTech Study 
2018 (Ankenbrand et al., 2018).  
2.2. Research methods 
This report draws mainly on a survey that was 
carried out in the spring of 2023. The 2023 
survey concentrated, similarly to the 2021 
survey, on the business model characteristics of 
Estonian FinTechs. These were analysed using 
the business model canvas of Osterwalder and 
Pigneur (2010), covering the key activities, key 
resources, value proposition, customer channels 
and segments, and revenue streams that have 
been modified by the value proposition and 
product/service delivery classifications from 
Eickhoff et al. (2017). However, compared to the 
survey 
instrument 
used 
in 
2021, 
some 
improvements were made. Firstly, the business 
model attributes covering technology were 
modified according to Imerman &amp; Fabozzi (2020) 
classification. Secondly, the opinions and 
evaluations of the future outlook and regulative 
changes were adjusted.  
 
In addition, this report includes section 3.2. the 
findings of which are based on the policy 
documents and eight semi-structured interviews 
with key policymakers (from the Ministry of 
Finance, Estonian Financial Supervision and 
Resolution Authority, and the Bank of Estonia) 
and an industry representative. This preparation 
of this part of the report has been supported by 
the Estonian Research Council grant PRG1125.

3. ESTONIAN FINTECH ENVIRONMENT
3.1. Changes in the legal 
environment 
By Mari-Liis Kukk 
 
As previous editions of this report (Laidroo et al., 
2021b; Tirmaste et al., 2019) have noted, the 
regulatory landscape for financial services in 
Estonia is based mostly on EU-wide agreements, 
as the union is seeking to ultimately achieve a 
single market for financial services. Harmonizing 
regulatory approaches among Member States is 
one important step in achieving that goal. 
However, there are also some local aspects, 
which must be focused on separately. As such, 
changes to the legal environment are covered in 
two parts. Firstly, Section 3.1.1. describes the 
FinTech-related 
changes 
currently 
being 
implemented in the EU law. Then, Section 3.1.2. 
discusses new additions to the local Estonian 
legislative framework. 
3.1.1. Changes in European Union Law 
As also mentioned in the previous edition of the 
report, EU regulatory ambitions surrounding 
innovative financial services specifically arise 
from the digital finance package, which was 
released in September 2020 and included several 
proposals for introducing new regulations. 
Although compared to the previous edition of 
the report, the digital finance package has not 
led to any significant new regulatory proposals, 
the initial texts have by now all gone through the 
legislative processes and have entered into force. 
The Regulation on European Crowdfunding 
Service Providers (ECSPR) entered into force on 
November 10, 2020, and was applied exactly 12 
months later, as expected. However, the initial 
expectation was that all existing crowdfunding 
platforms, which had previously been licensed 
under national rules, should have been 
transitioned to the new EU-wide license by 
November 10, 2022. However, on July 12, 2022, 
the EU Commission proposed to extend that 
deadline by 12 months, based on an assessment 
by the European Securities and Markets 
Authority that without an extension, several 
competent authorities may not be able to 
process the applications of service providers in 
due time, and large disruptions of crowdfunding 
markets could occur. (Regulation 2022/1988) 
 
The next regulatory development from the 
digital finance package to enter into force was 
the regulation of a pilot regime for market 
infrastructures based on distributed ledger 
technology (DLT), commonly known as the DLT 
Pilot regime, which entered into force on June 
23, 2022, and became applicable on March 23, 
2023. Unlike other regulations in the package, 
the aim of the DLT Pilot is not so much to apply 
regulatory demands to novel business models, 
but instead to create a special EU-wide sandbox-
esque regime for testing the use of DLT for the 
trading and post-trading of crypto-assets that 
qualify as regulated financial instruments. The 
reasoning behind creating this regime was that 
the regulatory treatment of such instruments is 
rather uncertain, and there exist certain 
regulatory obstacles in traditional rules regarding 
financial services that significantly hamper the 
use of DLT for financial market infrastructures. 
Under the regime, which all Member States have 
to apply directly, firms wishing to establish 
market infrastructures using DLT can apply for 
certain exemptions while still being able to offer 
their services publicly. The EU is hoping that 
allowing such experimentations will allow 
regulators to learn about the nuances of applying 
DLT, and lead to a permanent EU regulatory 
regime for such markets being established. 
(European Commission, 2020) 
 
The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), 
which aims to mitigate risks pertaining to cyber-
attacks, and put into place safeguards that would 
help all financial service providers ensure that 
risks 
involving 
the 
use 
of 
information 
communication 
technologies 
would 
be 
sufficiently accounted for, entered into force on 
January 16, 2023. However, its application date is 
set at January 17, 2025, with the standard 
implementation period of 12 months being 
doubled because of the high level of complexity 
involved in meeting the standards (Moek &amp; 
Huijpen, 2023). Notably, unlike other proposals 
in the digital finance package, DORA is not 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 11"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 
 
9 
 
targeted at any specific new financial service but 
is instead intended to cover novel risks arising 
from the increased digitalisation of financial 
services that affect all providers. What is more, 
the scope of DORA may also extend beyond 
financial 
services, 
as 
critical 
third-party 
technology providers will also have to meet 
certain requirements (KPMG, n.d.).  
 
The fourth, and currently the youngest digital 
finance package regulatory development is the 
Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation, 
which entered into force on 29 June 2023. The 
regulation includes disclosure requirements for 
the issuance, offering and admission to trading of 
so-called non-stablecoin crypto-assets while 
imposing 
stricter 
requirements, 
including 
authorisation requirements to crypto-assets 
deemed as stablecoins, which for MiCA purposes 
have been classified as either e-money tokens or 
asset-referenced tokens, depending on the 
specific 
setup. 
MiCA 
also 
introduces 
authorisation requirements for the service 
providers that facilitate transactions with crypto-
assets, listing eight different types of services 
that will have to comply with both universal and 
activity-specific 
requirements. 
Importantly, 
MiCA does not cover truly decentralized services, 
nor does it regulate unique, non-fungible tokens, 
which cannot be directly interchangeable with 
another token. Furthermore, as noted above, 
crypto-assets that fall under the definition of 
financial instruments will remain regulated 
under previously established rules. The timeline 
for MiCA application is set out in the regulation, 
with rules pertaining to stablecoins becoming 
applicable 12 months after MiCA entres into 
force, and the rest of MiCA applying 6 months 
later (Regulation 2023/1114). 
 
While not specifically named under the digital 
finance package, the EU has kept proceeding 
with a separate regulation on the information 
accompanying transfers of funds and certain 
crypto-assets (TfR) in tandem with MiCA. 
Fundamentally, this regulation introduces the so-
called “Travel Rule”, familiar from traditional 
financial services, to crypto asset service 
providers as well. The “Travel Rule” relates to the 
information that is passed along about the 
parties involved when executing electronic 
transactions, enabling to trace the movement of 
funds and identify all parties starting from the 
source to the final destination. This information 
can thus be used by law enforcement, for 
instance when investigating cases of money 
laundering and terrorist financing. The TfR will 
enter into force on the same date as MiCA. 
 
Aside from regulations directly targeted at 
financial services, FinTech companies may also 
have to consider other EU-wide regulations that 
have been recently introduced, such as the 
Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets 
Act (DMA), which were both published in the EU 
Official Journal in October 2022 and entered into 
force on November 16, 2022, and November 1, 
2022, respectively. The two acts work in unison 
and aim to provide better protection of the 
fundamental rights of customers online, combat 
illegal content and establish a level playing field 
when it comes to very large platforms. (European 
Commission, n.d.) Financial services are also set 
to be considered in the scope of the Artificial 
Intelligence Act (AI Act), which was first 
proposed in April 2021 and could be adopted in 
2023. The AI Act will classify artificial intelligence 
applications based on their presumed risks, with 
some applications being completely prohibited, 
others required to go through a pre-approval 
process and some having to disclose certain 
information aimed at increasing transparency 
(European Parliament, 2023). The EU is also 
currently working on harmonized rules for the 
use and access of data generated in EU markets, 
as first proposed via the Data Act in February 
2022 (European Commission, 2022). As this 
regulation aims to encourage the use of data to 
provide innovative financial services, it could 
have profound effects on financial markets. 
However, a certain draft of the Data Act has also 
been met with criticism, notably by DLT 
companies, as certain provisions may be in 
conflict with how smart contracts stored on 
blockchains operate (Schickler, 2023).  
3.1.2. Changes in the Estonian regulatory 
framework 
In terms of local regulations, the draft rules for a 
bespoke regime for crowdfunding and other 
alternative 
investments 
previously 
left 
unregulated (including crypto-assets), which was 
introduced by the Ministry of Finance on January 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 12"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 
 
10 
 
15, 2021, and mentioned in the previous edition 
of this report, have thus far not been made into 
law. While the regulation was submitted for 
approval to stakeholders in December 2021, and 
also to the Ministry of Justice in March 2022, 
there have been no public updates about the 
legislative process after that.  
 
In May 2023, the Ministry of Finance did, 
however, announce that they are working on a 
adoption of EU MiCA regulation described 
above. The Ministry of Finance also notified of 
their intention to designate the Estonian 
Financial Supervision and Resolution Authority 
as the competent authority for supervising 
crypto asset service providers (CASPs) under the 
new law, instead of the Financial Intelligence 
Unit, which has so far authorised CASPs under 
the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing 
Prevention Act (MLTFP). Previously, the MLTFP 
was also extensively amended in March 2022, 
with a focus on tightening requirements set for 
CASPs. For instance, the amendments required 
CASPs to submit a business plan when applying 
for authorisation, there was a significant increase 
in capital requirements, and all CASPs were 
subjected to external audit requirements. The 
amendments also included a version of the 
Travel Rule, under which certain identifiable 
information regarding the initiator of the 
transaction 
must 
be 
collected 
(Money 
Laundering and Terrorist ...). These changes 
arguably likened the requirements applicable for 
Estonian CASPs under local AML rules to those 
that will apply to CASPs EU-wide under the MiCA 
regulation. 
 
In addition to regulation, the Ministry of Finance 
and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and 
Communications are working on the Estonian 
FinTech Strategy 2023+. This document aims at 
determining the vision for FinTech in Estonia and 
setting targets for the coming years to overcome 
the main challenges of the sector. It is expected 
to be completed by the end of 2023. 
 
 
3.2. Estonia’s cautious approach 
towards regulatory sandboxes 
By Egert Juuse, Ringa Raudla 
 
The adoption of a regulatory sandbox (RS) for 
FinTech companies has been on the agenda of 
public institutions in Estonia for a few years, but 
to this date, it has not materialized, contrary to 
Latvia and Lithuania. Even though the first official 
steps were taken in 2019 (EBRD, 2019), when 
EBRD and the Ministry of Finance launched a 
project to support the creation of a RS in Estonia, 
Estonia has opted for the innovation hub format 
that was launched in 2021. Despite long-lasting 
discussions, several factors can be highlighted to 
explain why the launch of RS in Estonia has been 
delayed  
 
In a nutshell these could be summarized as 
follows:  
• 
ambivalence about the idea, the concept 
and the expected outcomes of the RS 
tool 
among 
policymakers 
and 
supervisors;  
• 
lack of interest from the political level 
about the RS; 
• 
missing mandates and legal grounds, 
and unsupportive institutional set-up of 
the 
central 
banking, 
competition 
promotion and supervision functions; 
• 
conservative 
and 
cautious 
characteristics 
of 
public 
sector 
organizations, 
and 
lacking 
internal 
capacities; 
• 
unsupportive financing arrangements of 
the FSA activities and suboptimality of 
the RS tool in a small state context;  
• 
Innovation Hub as a pre-condition and 
existing alternative substitute(s) for 
sandboxing (e.g. incubators);  
• 
the EU’s initiatives and regulatory 
landscape as ineffective triggers and 
enablers for temporary relaxation of 
adopted rules;  
• 
lack of demand for a RS from the existing 
FinTech sector.  
 
Overall, discussions about the adoption of a RS in 
Estonia have lasted for the last seven years and 
even though there has not been an active 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 13"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 
 
11 
 
opposition to the instrument, it has not been 
realized to this day. Most of the arguments 
against the creation of RS could be ascribed to 
small state peculiarities such as lacking financial 
resources, insufficient human capital, insufficient 
demand, low return on investment from a RS, 
and the availability of alternative and more 
optimal solutions. Other deterring factors have 
been revolving around legal uncertainty, lacking 
mandates and the missing political demand to 
deal with the topic. At the same time, one cannot 
neglect the role of idiosyncratic elements such as 
money laundering scandals of the Nordic banks 
and the failed regulatory ‘experiment’ with 
crypto service providers in the mid-2010s that 
fed a risk-averse and conservative stance among 
civil servants in the Ministry of Finance and the 
FSA.

4. FINTECH COMPANIES IN ESTONIA
4.1. Overview of Estonian FinTech 
companies 
By Triinu Tapver, Laivi Laidroo 
The discussion in this section is based on the list 
of FinTechs compiled by the authors of this 
report using data retrieved from the Crunchbase, 
Startup Estonia, FinTech Baltic, Key Capital, and 
FinanceEstonia databases as of December 2022. 
This data was complemented with companies 
identified amongst those that have received 
permits and licenses required for the provision of 
financial services in Estonia. To ensure a uniform 
definition of FinTechs, we applied the definitions 
given in Section 1. In addition, the list of FinTechs 
was cross-checked against the Estonian Business 
Registry to ensure that only active1 FinTechs 
incorporated in Estonia were considered. 
Our final list of Estonian FinTechs as of the end of 
2022 contains 264 companies which refers to an 
increase of 49 companies (23%) compared to the 
end of 2020.2 When comparing the list as at the 
end of 2022 with the one in 2020, in total of 126 
new FinTechs have entered the list. The total 
count of FinTechs has increased less due to exits 
from the list. 
From the 215 FinTechs in the 2021 report, 77, or 
36%, were excluded from the 2023 list. First, 45, 
companies were excluded due to missing data on 
their activity. In most cases, either the 
companies’ websites were down or they had lost 
the license they needed for running their 
operations, indicating that the actual activity of 
the 
company 
had 
stopped. 
Second, 
14 
companies had officially been deleted from the 
Estonian Business Registry, had gone bankrupt, 
or were being liquidated. Third, 13 companies 
had moved their business from Estonia to other 
countries. Fourth, 5 companies had turned out to 
be scams.  
1 We are not covering the companies that have ceased their 
operations or have no clear signs of operations (e.g., the 
virtual asset service provider licence holders with no 
activity or cancelled licences). 
The numbers presented above show that the list 
of FinTechs is constantly changing with old 
companies exiting and new ones entering. As the 
list of companies has become rather long 
(compared to just 84 in 2019) and, in many cases, 
the information about companies’ operations is 
not publicly readily available, the list is prone to 
contain some errors in terms of the count of 
companies and their classifications. 
All 
FinTechs 
were 
classified 
using 
the 
categorisations presented in Section 1. Some of 
the FinTechs are involved in activities that could 
be categorised in multiple ways, so an arbitrary 
decision was made giving preference to one 
activity above all others. As can be seen from 
Figure 4.1., four categories of FinTechs take up 
72% of the total population. These are digital 
asset exchange with 86 companies, or 33%, 
digital lending with 39 companies, or 15%, 
enterprise technology provisioning with 37 
companies, or 14%, and digital payments with 29 
companies, or 11% of the total population. 
WealthTech and digital capital raising take up 9% 
and 6% of the total population with 24 and 15 
companies, respectively. The rest of the 
companies in the remaining categories take up 
less than 5% of the total population. A more 
detailed overview of the population is provided 
in Appendix 1. 
Figure 4.1. Distribution of the number of 
Estonian FinTechs by type of activity 
2 Due to data collection and classification difficulties, we 
acknowledge that some FinTechs registered in Estonia, 
especially those registered in 2022 or later, may be missing 
from the list. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 15"></div><pre class="text-content">
13 
When comparing the populations of FinTechs 
across the 2023 and 2021 reports, it appears that 
their distribution has remained rather similar. 
The greatest increase of 9 percentage points has 
occurred in the proportion of FinTechs in the 
digital asset exchange category where the 
number of FinTechs has increased from 51 in 
2021 to 86 by 2023. When looking at these 
numbers, it is important to note that in our 
previous reports (Tirmaste et al., 2019; Laidroo, 
et al., 2021b), a very conservative approach was 
taken when including companies focusing on 
digital assets. This meant that only a handful of 
over 2000 companies that obtained the 
virtual asset 
service 
provider 
(VASP) 
license 
between 
2017-2022 
have 
been 
included 
(Rahapesu 
Andmebüroo, 
2022). Starting 
from 
2018, 
in 
the 
course 
of supervisory 
procedures, 
the 
Financial 
Intelligence 
Unit 
gradually 
cancelled most of these licenses and as 
on 
25 May 
2023 only 
93 
remain 
in 
force. 
The 
only 
reason why 
the 
total 
count of such companies has increased in 
our population is due to the addition of 
some companies for which we have been able 
to gather more data or that have been 
formed 
after 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
previous 
report. 
In 
other 
activity 
categories, 
the differences remain at ±8 
companies representing a rather modest 
change. 
Figure 4.2. Distribution of the number of 
FinTechs by year of establishment 
As can be seen from Figure 4.2., 152 FinTechs, or 
58%, are 3 to 5 years old and 38 FinTechs, or 14%, 
were established less than 3 years ago. This 
indicates that the majority of FinTechs are 
relatively young with 28% of all FinTechs being 
older than 5 years and only 11% being more than 
10 years old. When compared to the situation at 
the end of 2021, the proportion of FinTechs 3 to 
5 years old has increased by 5 percentage points. 
Correspondingly, the proportion of FinTechs 6 to 
10 years old has decreased by almost the same 
proportion. 
As can be seen from Figure 4.3., on average, the 
oldest companies are in digital banking. The age 
of these companies increased significantly due to 
re-classification of some FinTechs in this group. 
Older companies can also be found in digital 
lending, alternative credit &amp; data analytics, 
InsurTech, 
and 
enterprise 
technology 
provisioning. 
On 
average, 
the 
youngest 
companies are in WealthTech, RegTech and 
digital savings. This can be explained by the 
growing need for security, KYC procedures, fraud 
prevention, risk management and analytics, 
regulatory reporting, etc. When comparing 2023 
and 2021, the average age has increased by one 
to two years, in line with to gradual ageing of 
existing companies.  
Figure 4.3. The average age of companies by 
FinTech type 
The peak for the establishment of the existing 
FinTechs was in 2018 with 63 new FinTechs, 
followed by 2019 with 54 FinTechs and 2020 with 
28 FinTechs. The distribution of established 
companies by type during 2018-2022 can be 
seen in Figure 4.4. In 2018, digital asset exchange 
dominated with 29 established companies 
followed by enterprise technology provisioning 
with 10 established companies. The same 
indicators in 2019 were 26 and 5, respectively. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 16"></div><pre class="text-content">
14 
The remaining categories have been less 
frequent. Starting from 2020, the growth of new 
FinTechs has stalled remarkedly. In 2021 only 19 
and in 2022 only 15 companies were added to 
our list. This may be impacted by several factors, 
such as a stricter regulatory landscape, the 
market&#x27;s focus towards more mature FinTechs 
with a clearer path to profitability, worsening 
access to capital, and a recently deteriorated 
economic outlook as well as our poorer 
possibilities to identify very recently established 
FinTechs.  
Figure 4.4. The number of FinTechs established in 
2018–2020 by type of activity 
Based on the data obtained from the Tax and 
Customs Board as of the 4th quarter of 2022, 181 
FinTechs employed 2529 employees. This 
represents an increase of 27% compared to 
2020. 43 FinTechs in our list had no employees 
and, overall, 69% of the FinTechs have employed 
at least one employee. The largest proportion of 
employees was employed in digital lending with 
671 employees, followed by digital asset 
exchange with 486 employees, digital identity 
with 418 employees, and enterprise technology 
provisioning with 289 employees. This indicates 
that the remaining 26.3% of all employees were 
rather evenly divided between the remaining 
FinTech categories. 
The financial indicators of the FinTechs also 
deserve attention. Financial indicators are 
available for 233, or 88.3%, of the firms. Data is 
available mostly for FinTechs that are more than 
two years old. The current assessment is based 
on the latest data available for FinTechs. This 
means that most data is from 2021, however, the 
data of 19 FinTechs was taken from 2020. 
Based on our assessments, the volume of total 
assets of Estonian FinTechs as of the end of 2021 
was around 2.24 billion euros, this is a substantial 
growth compared to the value of assets as of 
2019, which was around 1.03 billion euros. 89% 
of the total value of assets, comes from FinTechs 
concentrating either on digital asset exchange, 
digital banking, or on digital lending. 
As can be seen from Figure 4.5., 133 FinTechs, or 
57% of FinTechs with available financial data, 
have assets valued at less than one million euros. 
Most such companies are involved in digital asset 
exchange. However, such companies account for 
the majority of companies in all FinTech 
categories with the exception of digital lending 
and digital banking. 24% of FinTechs have assets 
valued at 5 to 10 million euros. This group has a 
greater representation of FinTechs from digital 
asset exchange, digital lending, digital payments, 
and enterprise technology provisioning. This 
shows that Estonian FinTechs tend to be rather 
small. Companies with more than 100 million 
euros of assets are only found in digital banking, 
and digital lending due to their differing asset 
structure.  
Figure 4.5. Distribution of the number of 
FinTechs by total assets in millions of euros 
The quarterly 2022 total income data from the 
Tax and Customs Board were aggregated to 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 17"></div><pre class="text-content">
15 
obtain the indicative value of total income for the 
year. The total income generated by Estonian 
FinTechs as of the end of 2022 was around 400 
million euros. This is around a 42% increase from 
2021 when the total income was around 282 
million euros. As the number of FinTechs has 
increased by around 23% during the same 
period, it reflects that on average the FinTechs 
have become more active in providing their 
products and services. Still, it should be borne in 
mind that this number does not include net 
interest income that is not taxed with value-
added tax. 
Figure 4.6. Distribution of total income of 
Estonian FinTechs by type of activity 
As can be seen from Figure 4.6., 27% of the total 
income comes from digital lending, followed by 
digital asset exchange with 19% and digital 
identity with 18%. Enterprise technology 
provisioning accounts for 10% of total income, 
digital payments for 9%, and WealthTech 
accounts for 8%. The “other” section includes all 
the remaining types of FinTechs. 
The majority of Estonian FinTechs are relatively 
young, therefore, many have not yet become 
profitable. According to the available data, 57.4% 
of the companies that had submitted their 2021 
or 2020 annual report reported a positive result, 
while 6.5% reported 0 profit. It should also be 
considered that whether a profit or loss is 
reported depends on the owners’ choices of 
accounting approaches, for instance, how 
development costs are capitalised. The total net 
profit generated by all Estonian FinTechs in 2021 
was around 136 million euros. This is a 
substantial growth compared to 2019 when the 
total net profit was 64 million euros.  
The distribution of average net profit by type of 
FinTech activity is presented in Figure 4.7. Digital 
asset exchange is more profitable than other 
types of FinTech activities with an average net 
profit reaching over 1.2 million euros and a total 
net profit reaching 87.4 million euros. It is 
followed by digital lending with an average of 
0.96 million euros and digital custody with 0.80 
million euros. The figure omits the RegTech and 
digital identity that have been at a loss in 2021 as 
well as digital banking that was represented by 
two companies having net income level very 
different from other FinTechs.  
Figure 4.7. Distribution of average net profit of 
Estonian FinTechs by type of activity 
Overall, the latest available statistics show that 
digital asset exchange FinTechs are currently the 
most dominant among the Estonian FinTechs for 
their overall economic impact. 
4.2. Results of the survey 
By Laivi Laidroo 
4.2.1. General characteristics of the 
respondents 
In total, 33 FinTechs responded to the survey in 
March–May 2023. This accounts for 13% of the 
total population of Estonian FinTechs. In previous 
reports, the total count of responses has been 
greater and response rates have remained 
between 22% and 38%, meaning that the 
possibility to generalise the findings of this 
survey to the whole population of Estonian 
FinTechs remains somewhat lower. In the 2023 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 18"></div><pre class="text-content">
16 
survey, we received no responses from FinTechs 
representing digital custody and digital banking 
categories. Still, if we compare the composition 
of a sample by FinTech category across the 2023 
and 2021 surveys, these remain very similar. This 
indicates that the survey responses from the last 
two surveys are quite well comparable, and we 
present many results for these surveys hereafter 
in parallel.   
Most of the responses (73%) were given by 
either the CEO or owner of the company. The 
greatest number of responses were received 
from digital asset exchange companies, followed 
by digital lending and enterprise technology 
provisioning companies (see Figure 4.8.). 
Figure 4.8. Comparison of the survey sample and 
the total population 
Response rates exceeding 30% were obtained for 
FinTech activities with population size less than 
10 companies. Amongst more common FinTech 
activities, 18% of digital lending and 13% of 
WealthTech FinTechs responded. The lowest 0% 
response rate was among companies classified 
as digital custody and digital banking. Response 
rates below 13% are characterised also FinTechs 
involved in digital asset exchange and enterprise 
technology provisioning. This indicates that, 
similarly to earlier years, more popular activity 
types are crowded by companies that may be 
difficult to reach if they are in early development 
phases, want to avoid public attention, or do not 
consider themselves as FinTechs. 
12% of the respondents were from businesses 
that were already running and 88% were in the 
growth phase. While in previous years we have 
had 15 to 19% of respondents in the construction 
phase, no such companies responded to the 
survey this time.  
Although all respondents had a legal body in 
Estonia, two of them (6%) had headquarters 
elsewhere. 
The 
alternative 
headquarter 
locations mentioned included UK and Iceland. In 
previous survey rounds, the share of FinTechs 
with foreign headquarters has been more than 
two 
times 
greater, 
indicating 
that 
the 
respondents in this survey round are more 
strongly anchored to Estonia. 
33% of the respondents were active in 
FinanceEstonia, 30% in Startup Estonia, and 15% 
in the Estonian Founders Society (previously 
Estonian 
Startup 
Leaders 
Club). 
Many 
respondents 
were 
involved 
in 
several 
organisations 
simultaneously 
and 
some 
indicated cooperation on an international level. 
The latter can be partly explained by the 
presence of foreign founders as 18% of 
respondents indicated that they had used an e-
residency programme. Still, 18% of respondents 
were not cooperating with any Estonian 
organisation uniting FinTechs. Considering that 
more active attempts to contact FinTechs were 
made through FinanceEstonia, it reflects that the 
proportion of FinTechs that are not participating 
in any of the above-mentioned organisations is 
significantly larger. 
4.2.2. Business model attributes 
Key activities 
As our classification of FinTechs was arbitrary 
and FinTechs can be involved in different types of 
activities, we asked the respondents to indicate 
whether they were providing financial services 
themselves and/or are providing support 
services. 67% of the respondents provide 
financial services such as lending, capital raising, 
digital banking, payments, investment/asset 
management, trading or brokerage services, and 
digital wallets. 21% of respondents were 
involved in activities related to crypto-assets. 19 
respondents, or 57%, had at least one license for 
providing financial services. The most common 
was a licence from the Estonian Financial 
Supervision and Resolution Authority, owned by 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 19"></div><pre class="text-content">
17 
36% of respondents, followed by the licence 
from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit 
owned by 21% of respondents. 2 respondents 
had a licence from an authority in the EU (excl. 
Estonia).   
36% of the respondents support the provision of 
financial services by another company such as 
KYC-related activities, RegTech, data and credit 
analysis. 4 respondents, or 12%, provide financial 
services themselves and simultaneously also 
support the provision of financial services by 
other companies. The latter result demonstrates 
the complexity of categorising FinTechs by type 
of activity. 
Although 39% of the respondents had not 
outsourced any activities, the remaining FinTechs 
had outsourced at least some services. 
Programming and technical support had been 
outsourced by 39% and 27% of respondents, 
respectively. Some respondents mentioned also 
the outsourcing of accounting, legal, credit risk 
analysis, and KYC services. 
Key resources 
The main resources of FinTechs are technology 
and people. The majority of respondents listed 
several innovative technologies that they use in 
their activities. As can be seen from Figure 4.9., 
almost a third of FinTechs use either blockchain, 
Big Data Analytics, AI (Artificial Intelligence), or 
Open Source Computing (APIs). Cybersecurity 
and 
automation/robotics 
are 
used 
less 
frequently.  
Figure 4.9. Technologies employed by the 
respondents 
The average number of employees working in 
FinTechs that responded was 47, ranging from 1 
to 400. However, over half of the respondents 
had 12 or fewer employees. It should also be 
noted that while the total employee count of 
respondents was 1553, 43% of them were 
employed outside of Estonia. Compared to the 
survey conducted in 2021, the average employee 
count has increased by 22 employees and the 
proportion of employees outside of Estonia has 
increased by 10 percentage points. This indicates 
that surveyed Estonian FinTechs have remained 
open to global workforce either due to global 
focus of their business or shortage of skilled local 
employees. 
Figure 4.10. Expected change in the workforce 
for the year ahead from the beginning of  2021 
and 2023 
As can be seen from Figure 4.10., the majority of 
the respondents are expecting growth or 
substantial growth in the number of employees. 
Compared to the indications obtained in 2021, 
the proportion of respondents referring to an 
increase in the workforce has decreased by 14 
percentage points and the share of respondents 
referring to no change in the workforce has 
increased from 17% to 30%. This may be partly 
related to the increasing maturity of the firms, as 
well as the changes in the external environment 
that are capping the growth of companies’ 
activity. 
Value proposition 
Most of the respondents offer products / 
services with several value propositions (see 
Figure 4.11.).  


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 20"></div><pre class="text-content">
18 
Figure 4.11. Value proposition mentioned by the 
respondents 
The 
most 
frequently 
mentioned 
was 
transparency (e.g., improving access to timely 
and sufficient information) and monetary value 
(e.g., financial gain for the customer) which were 
mentioned by 67% of the respondents, followed 
by automation mentioned by 64% of the 
respondents and usability mentioned by 61% of 
respondents. Intermediation (e.g., helping to 
bring 
the 
client 
and 
seller 
together), 
consolidation (e.g., combining some things into a 
more 
effective 
and 
coherent 
whole), 
customisation according to the customer&#x27;s needs 
(e.g., 
personalised 
service), 
collaboration/ 
coordination for providing a service, improving 
insight (e.g., by enhancing customer awareness), 
financial risk management (e.g., improving the 
client&#x27;s 
financial 
risk 
management), 
and 
improving user security were mentioned slightly 
less frequently.  Compared to 2021 there have 
been rather minor changes in value proposition 
with the biggest increases occurring for 
transparency and monetary value. No clear trend 
could be identified between a specific type of 
FinTech and the mentioned value proposition. 
Still, the results do show that transparency and 
monetary value remain at the forefront for most 
Estonian FinTechs. Also, more versatile value 
propositions can be observed among FinTechs 
involved in enterprise technology provisioning, 
InsurTech, digital lending, and digital asset 
exchange. 
Customer segment 
When the respondents were asked to indicate 
where they operate, 72% responded that they 
operate both in Estonia and internationally and 
28% operate only in Estonia. When FinTechs 
were asked to list the countries in which they are 
already operating, then most European countries 
were mentioned. Several more distant countries 
and regions were also reported, including the 
USA, Mexico, Indonesia, Australia, and African 
countries. When asked into which countries the 
company intends to expand its activities in the 
future, the responses referred, in addition to 
European countries, also to the USA, Latin 
America, the Middle East, North Africa, 
Southeast Asia, and East Asia. 
The activity profile of the respondents shows 
that 76% of the respondents were involved in 
business-to-business, 
61% 
in 
business-to-
customer and 27% in business-to-business-to-
customer activities. 45% of the respondents 
were involved in a mix of the aforementioned 
activities. These proportions are rather similar to 
the ones observed in 2021. 
The total income of all the respondents in 2022 
was estimated to be 135 million euros and only 
33% of the respondents’ revenue exceeds 1 
million euros. On average, 43% of the revenue 
was from the export of goods and services with 
33% of FinTechs having export above 75% of 
revenue. Despite quite unpredictable external 
conditions, 82% of the respondents indicated 
that they do expect an increase in the revenues 
of the company in 2023 compared to 2022. 
Based on the companies’ estimates, total 
revenue in 2023 could reach 197 million euros, 
referring to a 46% increase compared to 2022. 
The average share of export is also expected to 
rise from an average of 43% in 2022 to 48% in 
2023. 
Overall, the results indicate that Estonian 
FinTechs continue to serve rather diverse 
customer 
segments 
and 
have 
a 
strong 
international focus in their activities. This can be 
explained by the small home market which 
forces companies to concentrate on global 
markets from the early phases of business 
creation. However, the worsening economic 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 21"></div><pre class="text-content">
19 
conditions seem to have a modest impact on the 
companies’ expected revenue for 2023. It might 
be more strongly reflected in profit estimates 
that we did not ask the companies to specify. 
Delivery channels 
As can be seen from Figure 4.12., 88% of the 
respondents indicated that their product and/or 
service delivery occurs through the web 
application and 61% indicated the use of an 
application programming interface (API). These 
were followed by 24% through mobile app and 
6% through instant messaging. Physical contact 
was indicated only by 4 respondents. The 
delivery channels have remained rather stable 
compared to 2021, with the exception of the use 
of mobile applications that can be related to the 
changed composition of respondents. 
Figure 4.12. Delivery channels mentioned by the 
respondents 
When looking at the use of different delivery 
channels across FinTech activities, it was possible 
to observe that less diverse delivery channels, 
covering a maximum of two channels, were 
among providers of digital capital raising, digital 
payments and RegTech. Simultaneous use of 
over three different delivery channels could be 
seen among FinTechs engaged in InsurTech and 
digital asset exchange. This shows that the main 
activity of the FinTechs influences strongly the 
number and set of delivery channels. 
Revenue streams 
Most respondents listed several items as streams 
of revenue. As can be seen from Figure 4.13., 
73% of the respondents mentioned commission 
income from services or products delivered.  
Figure 4.13. Sources of revenue mentioned by 
the respondents 
This source of revenue was more dominant in 
companies involved in InsurTech, WealthTech, 
digital payments, digital lending, digital capital 
raising, and digital asset exchange. Commission 
income played the greatest role in the revenue of 
FinTechs also in 2021, being mentioned by 64% 
of FinTechs. 27% of the respondents mentioned 
centralised hosting of business applications 
(SaaS – software as a service). This revenue 
stream dominated the responses of FinTechs 
involved in RegTech and enterprise technology 
provisioning. License fee from a product or 
software licencing was mentioned by 21% of the 
respondents, being more strongly present in 
RegTech firms. Interest income, income from 
data, trading and advertising were mentioned 
less frequently. As 55% of the respondents 
referred to two or more different revenue 
sources. As this number is significantly lower 
than the 80% reported in the 2021 report,  some 
decrease in the diversification of revenue 
streams appears to have occurred. 
4.2.3. Location choices 
The respondents were asked to assess the 
importance of several different factors that 
affected their decision to register the company in 
Estonia from less important to more important 
on a scale of 1 to 7 (see Figure 4.14. for results). 
The results show that FinTech entrepreneurs 
valued the ease of establishing a company and 
good quality digital infrastructure the most. Both 
aspects received an average score of 6.2. Quite 
even emphasis, ranging from 5.6 to 5.8 average 
points, was given to Estonia’s reputation, 
knowledge 
of 
the 
local 
entrepreneurial 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 22"></div><pre class="text-content">
20 
environment, regulatory clarity, availability of 
qualified workforce, and low level of corruption. 
The lowest relevance was put on materials / 
events introducing Estonia as a place of doing 
business (evaluated on average at 3.4 points), 
preceded by the sufficiency of customer base 
and availability of capital. The low relevance of 
introductory materials and quite significant 
relevance of the knowledge about the local 
entrepreneurial environment can be related to a 
rather 
large 
representation 
of 
local 
entrepreneurs among the surveyed companies. 
This is reflected in the fact that only 6 
respondents, representing less than 18% of the 
respondents, indicated the use of the e-
residency programme by their founders. 
Figure 4.14. Decisive factors for location choice 
Compared to the evaluations on location choice 
in 2021, the ones provided in 2023 appear rather 
similar. This indicates that the entrepreneurs’ 
opinions 
regarding 
locations 
choice 
have 
remained stable over the past two years. 
6 of the 33 respondents mentioned that they had 
considered registering the company in some 
other country. Other countries mentioned in that 
context included UK, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, 
and Germany. When asked to comment about 
the decisive factor in preferring Estonia each 
respondent had their reason. Mentioned factors 
included corporate tax (no tax is paid on retained 
earnings), e-services, startup ecosystem and 
personal network. Although a favourable 
regulatory climate was mentioned, it came with 
a remark that the same would not apply now. 
Indicating that in the eyes of the respondents, 
Estonian regulatory conditions had deteriorated. 
Similarly, a respondent indicated that the costs 
were low years ago, but now the UK would be a 
better place to start FinTech. Still, another 
respondent 
mentioned 
that 
they 
initially 
preferred the UK, but this idea was neglected 
due to Brexit. The diversity of these explanations 
shows that the location choice of each FinTech 
does tend to remain rather specific. 
It is quite alarming that 10 out of 31 FinTechs that 
are currently located in Estonia have discussed 
the possibility of moving the company’s 
operations abroad. Some have considered it for 
improving their access to customers by being 
closer to bigger markets or by gaining added 
credibility in the eyes of the customers. At the 
start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, also 
the risk of war was one of the triggers of such 
discussions. 
Several 
respondents 
brought 
forward too tight conditions for the virtual asset 
service provider (VASP) licensing. Also, some 
claimed 
that 
Estonia 
uses 
more 
strict 
requirements for client onboarding, foreign 
investors have problems opening Estonian bank 
accounts, and regulators remain less supportive 
towards innovation. Regulatory factors that may 
affect the operations of some FinTechs can also 
relate to the lack of factoring licencing in Estonia, 
different cross-country interpretations on how 
external insurance partners can operate in 
Estonia (whether you need a branch or can 
operate under the freedom to provide service 
model), the applicability of investment account 
system on investment companies and remote 
identification requirements.  
Overall, the results indicate that Estonia may be 
the first choice for local entrepreneurs due to 
greater familiarity with local conditions and 
stronger networks. However, poor access to 
customers and regulatory challenges may force 
companies to select alternative destinations or 
even re-consider their initial location decisions 
over time. Worsening geopolitical conditions 
may also open discussions about where it is safe 
enough to set up and maintain your business. 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 23"></div><pre class="text-content">

4.2.4. Current challenges for FinTechs 
The respondents were asked to evaluate the 
extent that specific problems affect their 
business on a scale of 1 to 7 from not pressing to 
extremely pressing. As can be seen from Figure 
4.15., the most critical problems are related to 
finding customers, scoring 5.5, expansion to 
foreign markets, scoring 5.2, and economic 
conditions and access to finance, both scoring 
5.1. Quite similar relevance with evaluations 
ranging between 4.2 and 4.9 was attributed to 
the remaining factors. 
Figure 4.15. Current pressing problems on a scale 
of 1 to 7  
It does appear that compared to 2021, the access 
to finance and cost of production or labour have 
exhibited the greatest increase in evaluations, 
both increasing on average by 0.6 points. At the 
same time, the expansion of product portfolio 
and building partnerships with established 
players have decreased their relevance to a 
similar extent. These changes appear to be 
strongly linked to changes occurring in the 
economic conditions that ranked the third 
concern in 2023. As that claim was not part of the 
2021 survey, we cannot compare it to a previous 
evaluation. Although in the previous survey, the 
regulatory aspects were framed a bit differently, 
their 2021 score of 5.3 (2nd largest), is 
significantly greater than the 4.4 reported in 
2023. This does indicate that the urgency of 
regulatory aspects has decreased against the 
backdrop of other more burning issues.  
We also analysed the answers across FinTech 
categories. Among the two most relevant 
respondent groups, the most striking differences 
were observed for regulation. Pressure from the 
regulation side was the strongest for FinTechs 
involved in digital asset exchange, scoring at 5.9, 
compared to only 4.0 for FinTechs in digital 
lending. This can be related to the regulatory 
changes that put greater pressure on the 
activities of these types of FinTechs the most (see 
section 3). At the same time, a top-performing 
concern for FinTechs in digital lending was access 
to finance, scoring 6.1, that for FinTech in digital 
asset exchange received a score of 4.9. Still in 
both groups, finding customers remained the 
second most important concern. This indicates 
that there do remain some differences across 
FinTechs focusing on different activities.   
Figure 4.16. Regulative and regulator-related 
factors restricting the expansion to foreign 
markets 
We also wanted to know what restricts the 
expansion of FinTechs to foreign markets. When 
asked about regulative and regulator-related 
factors (see Figure 4.16.). The most critical were 
the restrictions on IT solutions that are available 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 24"></div><pre class="text-content">
22 
for identifying and verifying a person and 
collecting and checking data on the activities of 
customers, both scoring 4.2 on a scale of 1 to 7. 
Compared to the 2021 survey, these factors have 
increased in their relevance on average 0.5 to 0.8 
points. At the same time, we see that the 
cooperation 
with 
regulators, 
regulators’ 
readiness to understand new business models 
and 
their 
readiness 
to 
involve 
market 
participants have improved up to 0.8 points in 
the eyes of FinTechs. More cooperative 
relationships with regulators may explain why 
FinTechs have begun to perceive activity 
restrictions arising from regulations as less 
relevant, in general.   
As can be seen from Figure 4.17., most non-
regulation-specific factors receive an even lower 
score. The highest score, reaching 4.3, was given 
to the lack of contact and network and to 
difficulties in finding employees. This indicator is 
0.7 points greater than in 2021. The remaining 
factors receive scores below the middle of the 
range, indicating that more “classical” factors 
inhibiting expansion to the foreign markets are 
less relevant and the regulation-related factors 
tend to dominate these. 
Figure 4.17. Other factors that might restrict the 
expansion of business to foreign markets 
Overall, we can conclude that the main 
challenges that FinTechs face have somewhat 
tilted away from regulation-related aspects 
towards their everyday activities. The expansion 
to foreign markets remains less restricted by 
poor cooperation with regulators and has 
become more strongly impacted by restrictions 
on the use of technological solutions and 
requirements concerning customer monitoring.  
4.2.5. FinTech sector outlook 
We asked the respondents several questions 
concerning their views on the development 
potential, funding sources, and regulatory 
developments. 
On a scale of 1 to 7, the respondents evaluated 
the overall strength of the competitive position 
of the Estonian FinTech sector. The average score 
was 4.8 with 73% of the responses remaining at 
5 or above. This indicates that the companies 
view the situation as above-average. The 
greatest development potential in Estonian 
FinTech was seen in very different areas. Some 
emphasized 
cloud-based 
systems, 
web3 
environment, while others mentioned services, 
including support services for financial sector 
companies. The activity areas emphasized 
covered credit products, digital/crypto assets, 
data, 
crowdfunding, 
payments 
investment 
accounts, and e-treasury. Some remained critical 
about the ability of Estonian FinTech to scale 
their applications due to a lack of international 
expertise.  
When we asked FinTechs to indicate the most 
important funding sources for FinTechs in the 
next three years, seed capital and venture capital 
prevailed with both being ranked the 1st by 
almost a third of respondents. Although the 
same funding sources were on top in the 2021 
survey, the position of seed capital has 
somewhat weakened as then it was ranked first 
by 51% of the respondents. More traditional 
funding sources like equity funding from 
financial institutions, equity funding from the 
company itself, and private funding from other 
sectors were ranked lower. The lowest 
importance was attributed to debt funding, as in 
2021. 
When the respondents were asked to rank eight 
measures that would help to develop their 
company and / or the Estonian FinTech sector 
further, some interesting patterns emerged (see 
Figure 4.18). Improving regulations and tax 
reliefs were the top-ranking measures. This 
indicates the regulations remain an important 
aspect to consider despite remaining a bit 
further behind in everyday struggles for 
FinTechs. Better cooperation with relevant 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 25"></div><pre class="text-content">
23 
authorities ranked a bit further behind and the 
average rank of that claim increased almost by 1 
compared to 2021. This development supports 
the earlier notion that the cooperation with 
regulators seems to have improved and, 
therefore, its further improvement is not as 
important as it was in 2021. The following 
measures were the support for hiring foreign 
workforce, developing a sandbox, specialised 
incubators, and startup visa. As in 2021, the 
worst ranking was the cooperation with research 
and education institutions. 
Figure 4.18. Ranking of factors potentially 
improving Estonian FinTech sector development 
The respondents brought forward several 
regulatory aspects that should receive more 
attention. Improvement of remote identification 
and online verification outside of European 
Economic Area countries was mentioned. 
Offering some sort of licencing in areas that do 
not currently require licencing or improving the 
investment account system, could potentially 
improve the outlook of Estonian FinTechs. Some 
suggested that Estonian regulations, in general, 
should be more similar to more innovative 
countries in Europe and the regulatory 
environment 
should 
become 
multilingual. 
Others mentioned more general factors, like 
making the debt collection processes faster, 
creating a positive credit register, allowing long-
term investment products by employers at the 
same terms as employer’s option programmes, 
or introducing a social tax ceiling. 
Seven 
respondents 
commented 
on 
the 
questions related to crowdfunding regulation. 
Three (42%) of them indicated that further 
regulation of crowdfunding is needed and mainly 
to avoid scams. When they were asked to 
evaluate how well the EU crowdfunding 
regulation reduces the risks in the sector on a 
scale of 1 (does not reduce at all) to 7 (reduces 
significantly), the average score was 4.71. this 
indicates that the respondents admitted the risk-
mitigating impact of this regulation. Quite similar 
views were expressed by market participants 
also in the 2021 survey.  
Seven respondents commented also on the EU 
proposal for regulating crypto currencies. The 
majority of the respondents fell under the 
regulation’s 
Title 
V 
crypto-asset 
service 
providers. Still, some were also under Title II 
crypto-Assets, other than asset-referenced 
tokens or e-money tokens; Title III asset-
referenced tokens; or Title IV Electronic money 
tokens. Four of the respondents had already 
adjusted their business activities to the new 
regulation, two needed less than 6 months to 
comply, and only one respondent required 6 to 
12 months for achieving compliance. When 
asked to name the requirement that was/is the 
hardest to adopt, the travel rule, tax reporting, 
own funds requirement, and request to have 
unique paperwork were mentioned. As this 
survey probably reached more active crypto 
service providers, the actual adoption level and 
potential for the whole population of Estonian 
FinTechs is likely to remain at a significantly 
lower level.  
On a scale of 1 (not appropriate at all) to 7 (very 
appropriate), 
these 
seven 
respondents 
evaluated also the sufficiency of the application 
field of the crypto asset regulation proposal. The 
average score was 4.4, indicating a rather 
positive opinion. However, the respondents 
were much more critical about how well the 
same regulation reduces risks in the sector. The 
average score was 2.8 which indicates a very 
modest reduction of risks. These results show 
that although some aspects of the regulation are 
viewed positively, there remains room for 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 26"></div><pre class="text-content">
24 
improvement. The same tendencies were 
observed already in the 2021 survey, with the 
same scores being 4.2 and 3.9, respectively. 
When asked to highlight areas that needed 
further 
regulations, 
57% 
of 
respondents 
mentioned providing credit in exchange for 
crypto-assets, 42% mentioned the NFTs, and 
decentralized service providers and only one 
respondent marked storing crypto-assets for 
earning interest (staking). Two respondents 
provided no input for further regulation areas 
and firmly stated that no further regulation is 
needed.  
On the negative side, 71% of respondents, 
indicated that the crypto asset regulation 
approval would lead to the closure of a 
significant portion of Estonian crypto companies. 
28% of the respondents also believed that some 
crypto companies in Estonia will either 
consolidate or acquire a license from another EU 
country. Only one respondent thought that 
companies with licenses from abroad will 
acquire new licenses based on the new 
regulation from Estonia. This indicates that the 
market 
participants 
believe 
a 
further 
consolidation of the Estonian crypto market 
which has anyhow been through significant 
negative developments during recent years with 
the cancellation of the majority of the VASP 
licenses.

5. CONCLUSION
This report aimed to provide an overview of the 
recent developments influencing the Estonian 
FinTech sector and the main characteristics and 
challenges of the FinTechs. A survey of FinTech 
companies was used to draw some general 
conclusions. 
First, the economic impact of FinTech is gradually 
increasing. Although the growth in the number 
of FinTechs has decelerated, compared to the 
end of 2020, the count of FinTechs has increased 
by 23%, reaching 264 firms by the end of 2022. 
The deceleration of growth arises as the growth 
of FinTechs by 126 companies has been 
counterbalanced with an exit of 77 former 
FinTech list constituents. As of the end of 2021, 
the total assets of FinTechs stood already at 2.24 
billion euros, 1.2 times the numbers in 2019. 
Total 
income 
generated 
in 
2022 
was 
approximately 400 million euros, an increase of 
70% compared to 2020 and survey respondents 
were expecting on average a 46% increase in 
income on a year-by-year basis in 2023. As of the 
end of 2022 4th quarter, the total employee count 
was 2529 which is 27% greater than in 2020. Still, 
30% of survey respondents did indicate that no 
change in employment in 2023 is expected and 
compared to the 2021 survey, the proportions of 
respondents indicating an increase in the 
workforce has decreased by 14 percentage 
points. This does indicate that the economic 
conditions are likely to influence also the 
activities of FInTechs, however, their impact on 
income may remain less evident.  
Second, the field remains dominated by 
companies involved in digital asset exchange that 
account for 33% of all Estonian FinTechs despite 
the significant decline in the number of 
companies having a valid VASP license. This 
reflects the impact of past decisions regarding 
licensing, however, given the coming changes 
with the MiCA adoption, the share of this FinTech 
category is likely to decrease, as estimated also 
by survey respondents. Despite the strong 
presence of FinTechs focusing on crypto assets, 
the Estonian FinTech space remains diverse with 
a strong presence of FinTechs involved in digital 
lending, enterprise technology provisioning, 
digital payments WealthTech and others.  
Third, the business models of Estonian FinTechs 
have not changed significantly. Innovative 
technologies in the form of blockchain, big data, 
AI etc. are applied and, in many cases, also 
outsourced from outside the company. Value 
proposition remains dominated by transparency 
(e.g., improving access to timely and sufficient 
information) and monetary value (e.g., financial 
gain for the customer). The majority of FinTechs 
have continued to operate both in Estonia and 
internationally, providing mainly business-to-
business or business-to-customer services. 
FinTech services are delivered mainly through 
web applications and APIs with most of the 
income coming through commission fees. 
Fourth, entrepreneurs’ location choices have not 
changed 
significantly. 
Local 
FinTech 
entrepreneurs prefer Estonia due to familiarity 
with local conditions and stronger networks. Still, 
given that nearly a third of respondents had 
considered relocating their business, poor access 
to customers and regulatory challenges may 
force 
companies 
to 
select 
alternative 
destinations or even re-consider their initial 
location decisions over time.  
Fifth, the greatest challenges for FinTechs lie in 
finding customers, expansion to foreign markets, 
economic conditions and access to finance. 
Compared to 2021, the concerns had most 
strongly increased in the area of access to 
finance and cost of labour, reflecting the recent 
developments in the macroeconomy and global 
venture capital markets. Interestingly, these 
developments had somewhat decreased the 
relative importance of regulatory concerns, 
especially 
amongst 
FinTechs 
from 
fields 
unrelated to crypto-assets. 
Sixth, when considering expanding their business 
abroad, FinTechs do view their relationship with 
regulators more positively compared to the 2021 
survey. A greater obstacle is perceived in the 
form of regulative restrictions to IT solutions, 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 28"></div><pre class="text-content">
 
 
 
 
26 
 
collecting and checking data and lack of contacts 
and networks abroad. 
 
Seventh, FinTechs consider the Estonian FinTech 
sector to be competitive on an average level. The 
greatest development potential is seen in cloud-
based systems, web3 environment, and support 
services for financial sector companies. Still, 
when ranking the factors that could enhance the 
Estonian FinTech sector, regulations and tax 
reliefs emerge on top. On the positive side, 
compared to 2021, the respondents view 
cooperation with relevant authorities more 
positively.  
 
Respondents indicated that they would like to 
see Estonian regulations more in line with similar 
innovative European countries. More specific 
regulatory aspects that would deserve attention, 
based on the opinion of FinTechs, were the 
following: 
• 
Improvement of remote identification 
and online verification outside of 
European Economic Area countries. 
• 
Some sort of licencing in areas that do 
not currently require licencing to 
broaden the business opportunities for 
Estonian FinTechs (e.g., factoring). 
• 
Improving 
the 
investment 
account 
system 
to 
make 
it 
available 
for 
investment companies. 
• 
Making the regulatory environment 
multilingual. 
• 
Making debt collection faster. 
• 
Creating a positive credit register. 
• 
Allowing long-term investment products 
by the employer at the same terms as 
employer’s option programmes. 
• 
Introducing social tax ceiling. 
• 
Improving investors’ possibilities for 
opening Estonian bank accounts. 
 
Overall, the Estonian FinTech sector remains 
strong and if the challenges can be properly 
handled, Estonia would remain an attractive 
location for FinTechs with global ambitions.
