Proof of achievement of MoU
objective
Our COST Action CA19130 is focused on developing blended approaches to evaluate
innovative financial services and their providers, especially in the FinTech domain. One
of our main goals is to build on Machine Learning methods, with a focus on prediction
(early warning) of operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal behavior ranging from
appropriation of loaned funds to money-laundering activities.
To achieve this goal, we have formed several strategic partnerships. One such
partnership is with the Romanian Fintech company iFactor, which has allowed us to
work on the research and development of AI tools for financial risk assessment. We
have also formed a partnership with ING Group, Amsterdam Netherlands. Early
warning systems are one of the main focus of many of our partner companies, and ING
Group&#x27;s early warning credit system is one of the leading European early warning credit
systems. Our COST CA19130 is substantially in ongoing research to improve and
extend their system.
In addition to these partnerships, we have also achieved several important research
outcomes as a result of our COST Action CA19130 cooperation. For example, the
Swiss National Science Foundation is supporting a research project on Anomaly and
Fraud Detection in Blockchain networks, which is being worked on by our COST Action
members. Additionally, we have a research project with a Swiss Fintech company,
where we are supporting them to improve the default rating of loans. These examples
demonstrate our commitment to developing new and improved theories, models,
methodologies, technologies, and techniques in the field of fintech and financial
services.
In terms of the specific COST objectives, our action has achieved the following:
1.a - Development of a common understanding/definition of the subject matter: By
working closely with practitioners from the finance industry and regulators, we have
developed a shared understanding of the subject matter and the challenges facing the
industry. This has allowed us to develop blended approaches that are tailored to meet
the specific needs of the industry.1.e - Development of knowledge needing international
coordination: Our action has brought together researchers from 49 countries globally,
and 39 European COST countries, allowing for the development of knowledge that
requires international coordination. By working together, we have been able to tackle
complex research questions and develop new and improved theories, models,
methodologies, technologies, and techniques. 
Overall, our COST Action CA19130 is making significant contributions to the field of

fintech and financial services. By forming strategic partnerships and working closely
with practitioners, regulators, and researchers, we are able to develop blended
approaches that are tailored to meet the specific needs of the industry, while also
contributing to the development of new and improved theories, models, methodologies,
technologies, and techniques that are necessary for the field to evolve.
Mou objective
The development of conceptual and methodological tools for establishing when black-
box models are admissible and, to the extent possible, making them more transparent
and/or replacing them with interpretable and explainable models.

Proof of achievement of MoU
objective
Transparency, interpretability and explainability of black-box models has become one of
the main research agendas of our COST Action CA19130. Our members have worked
together on a substantial number of publications, research proposals, and various
explainable AI tools.
To achieve this goal, we have organized many research conferences around this topic
with a substantial number of participants. We also disseminated the code and training
material on this topic via quantlet.com and quantinar.com and created an extensive
platform on Explainable AI for finance with several use cases, all papers, code
repositories, interactive apps, see https://www.explainableaiforfinance.com/.
We have also made significant contributions to the development of conceptual and
methodological tools for establishing when black-box models are admissible and
making them more transparent and/or replacing them with interpretable and explainable
models. For example, a paper published by the Action provides insights on the early
lapse phenomenon for the insurance contracts, exploiting interpretability algorithms
applied to random forest. By applying interpretability to black-box instruments, the
authors were able to show how it can give light to a phenomenon not easily explainable
by white-box algorithms.
Our research team has introduced different measures of local and global interpretability
for different machine learning tasks, such as clustering, classification and regression,
but also for different types of data such as continuous, categorical, hierarchical, and
functional. 
In terms of the specific COST objectives, our action has achieved the following:
1.a - Development of a common understanding/definition of the subject matter: By
working closely with other researchers and practitioners in the field, we have developed
a shared understanding of the subject matter and the challenges facing the industry.
This has allowed us to develop tools and approaches that are tailored to meet the
specific needs of the industry.1.c - Coordination of experimentation or testing: We have
organized research conferences and events, which have provided opportunities for
researchers to test and experiment with the tools and approaches that have been
developed as a result of our COST Action. Additionally, the code and training material
that we have made available via quantlet.com, quantinar.com and our Explainable AI
for finance platform, allows researchers and practitioners to test and experiment with
these tools in their own work. This coordination of experimentation and testing has
been crucial in helping us to establish when black-box models are admissible and in
developing new methods for making these models more transparent. 
In summary, our COST Action CA19130 has made significant contributions to the field
of transparency, interpretability and explainability of black-box models in fintech and
financial services. By organizing research conferences, events and developing a
platform on Explainable AI for finance, we have created a space for the sharing of ideas
and perspectives and the testing and experimentation of new tools and approaches.
This has led to the development of new conceptual and methodological tools for
establishing when black-box models are admissible and in making them more

objective
Our COST Action CA13910 has achieved the objective of disseminating the results of
our research on investment product performance evaluation to the public and regulators
through a comprehensive approach. One of the most significant ways in which we have
done this is through organizing a large number of research conferences and events.
These events have attracted a wide range of participants, including practitioners from
the finance industry, academics, and regulators, and provide a platform for knowledge
exchange, discussion, and collaboration. The list of all the events can be found at
https://www.meetup.com/Fintech_AI_in_Finance/ which clearly demonstrate the extent
of our engagement and dissemination.
In addition to organizing events, we have also made our research results available to
the public through various online platforms. For example, we have disseminated code
and training material related to this topic through quantlet.com and quantinar.com,
7

making it easily accessible for anyone interested in the topic. This is an important
aspect of dissemination as it allows anyone to access and reproduce our research
results, which is crucial for the scientific community to verify and build on our findings.
We also have an extensive online platform on Explainable AI for finance which includes
several use cases, all papers, code repositories, interactive apps, see
https://www.explainableaiforfinance.com/ which can be accessed by anyone interested
in the topic.
Moreover, our GP3 has several dedicated Action meetings related to regulators, most
notably the COST CA19130 meets Brussels event, hosted at the premises of the COST
Association in Brussels. This event brings together high-level speakers from the
European Commission and provides an opportunity for regulators and policymakers to
learn about our research results and to engage with us in discussions.
All of these efforts have enabled us to disseminate our research results to the general
public (1.i) and to stakeholders such as regulators (1.j) in an effective and
comprehensive manner. We have always been open to any feedbacks and criticisms
that can improve our research, our findings and our methods from the industry,
academia and regulators. Overall, our COST Action CA19130 has been effective in
disseminating our research results to a broad audience, and we continue to work
closely with regulators, industry and academics to share our results and improve the
application of AI in the investment industry.

Our COST Action CA19130 has become one of the largest and most active COST
Actions in all of Europe. Our network comprises 49 countries globally, of which 39 are
European COST countries. We have more than 260 working group members now, with
almost all countries represented in each working group.
Our network is cooperating in many different ways and a substantial number of
(changing) subgroups have formed that work on joint publications, research
applications and output. We have initiated a meetup group,
8


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 9"></div><pre class="text-content">
DRAFT
https://www.meetup.com/Fintech_AI_in_Finance/, with now more than 2000 members
globally. Our more than 150 events so far have been attended by more than 7000
participants.
To achieve this, we have implemented several strategies:
Encouraging active participation from all members: We have made it a priority to ensure
that all members are actively engaged in the network and have opportunities to
contribute to research projects and events. 
Promoting interdisciplinary collaboration: Our network brings together researchers from
a wide range of disciplines, including computer science, economics, finance, and
mathematics. We have encouraged these researchers to work together on
interdisciplinary projects, which has led to a more diverse range of perspectives and
ideas.
Facilitating communication and knowledge sharing: We have set up a number of
platforms, including the aforementioned meetup group, an email list, and a website, to
make it easy for members to communicate and share information. This has helped to
create a sense of community within the network.
Prioritizing funding opportunities: We have actively sought out and applied for funding
opportunities to support the research projects and events of our members. This has not
only provided financial resources, but also helped to create a sense of shared
investment in the network&#x27;s success.
Encourage the formation of sub-groups: Through the formation of sub-groups which
work together on specific research area/output this helped members work together in

researchers.
For the organization of events, FinAI has established guidelines to improve diversity in
terms of gender balance, country, and age of participants and organizers. For example,
guidelines state: &quot;Respect that the organizing committee and the scientific committee
are composed according to criteria for gender balance&quot;, &quot;If there is more than one
keynote speaker, choose a scholar belonging to the underrepresented gender in that
specific event&quot;, &quot;Avoid involving women only in the roles of moderators or session
chairs during events, workshops or conferences.&quot; &quot;Avoid assigning to women only
duties or tasks considered as “academic households”, tasks that are time-consuming
but do not give opportunity for women to be involved in research activities.&quot; Members of
COST participating on the organizing committee make sure these guidelines are
respected whenever possible.
To improve gender equality in the field, the COST Action CA19130 FinAI is constantly
monitoring the gender representation among its members and taking specific measures
to increase the presence of female members in the working groups, management
committee and in the organization of events. The virtual mobility grants is also been
given to female researcher which is one of the important measure to empower and
support female researcher in the field of FinAI.
 
In addition to the measures mentioned above, COST Action CA19130 FinAI also
promotes the participation and leadership of female members through various initiatives
such as:
Encouraging the nomination of female members for leadership roles within the action
such as working group leaders, management committee members and coordinators.
Offering mentorship and networking opportunities for female members to connect with
experienced researchers in the field and to help them to develop the skills needed to
take on leadership roles.
Organizing training and development workshops specifically tailored to the needs of
female members to help them to build their skills and confidence in their field.
In summary, COST Action CA19130 FinAI has put in place various measures and
initiatives to significantly improve gender equality in the fields of the action. The Action
is being monitored and evaluated regularly to see the impact of the measures and to
make necessary adjustments, with the goal of creating an inclusive and equitable
