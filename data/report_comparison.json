One\nof our main goals is to build on Machine Learning methods, with a focus on prediction\n(early warning) of operational fragility, fraudulent and illegal behavior ranging from\nappropriation of loaned funds to money-laundering activities.\nTo achieve this goal, we have formed several strategic partnerships. One such\npartnership is with the Romanian Fintech company iFactor, which has allowed us to\nwork on the research and development of AI tools for financial risk assessment. We\nhave also formed a partnership with ING Group, Amsterdam Netherlands. Early\nwarning systems are one of the main focus of many of our partner companies, and ING\nGroup's early warning credit system is one of the leading European early warning credit\nsystems. Our COST CA19130 is substantially in ongoing research to improve and\nextend their system.\nIn addition to these partnerships, we have also achieved several important research\noutcomes as a result of our COST Action CA19130 cooperation. For example, the\nSwiss National Science Foundation is supporting a research project on Anomaly and\nFraud Detection in Blockchain networks, which is being worked on by our COST Action\nmembers. Additionally, we have a research project with a Swiss Fintech company,\nwhere we are supporting them to improve the default rating of loans. These examples\ndemonstrate our commitment to developing new and improved theories, models,\nmethodologies, technologies, and techniques in the field of fintech and financial\nservices.\nIn terms of the specific COST objectives, our action has achieved the following:\n1.a - Development of a common understanding/definition of the subject matter: By\nworking closely with practitioners from the finance industry and regulators, we have\ndeveloped a shared understanding of the subject matter and the challenges facing the\nindustry. This has allowed us to develop blended approaches that are tailored to meet\nthe specific needs of the industry.1.e - Development of knowledge needing international\ncoordination: Our action has brought together researchers from 49 countries globally,\nand 39 European COST countries, allowing for the development of knowledge that\nrequires international coordination. By working together, we have been able to tackle\ncomplex research questions and develop new and improved theories, models,\nmethodologies, technologies, and techniques. \nOverall, our COST Action CA19130 is making significant contributions to the field of\nfintech and financial services.

We have initiated a meetup group,\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Fintech_AI_in_Finance/, with now more than 2000 members\nglobally. Our more than 150 events so far have been attended by more than 7000\nparticipants.\nTo achieve this, we have implemented several strategies:\nEncouraging active participation from all members: We have made it a priority to ensure\nthat all members are actively engaged in the network and have opportunities to\ncontribute to research projects and events. \nPromoting interdisciplinary collaboration: Our network brings together researchers from\na wide range of disciplines, including computer science, economics, finance, and\nmathematics. We have encouraged these researchers to work together on\ninterdisciplinary projects, which has led to a more diverse range of perspectives and\nideas.\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nFacilitating communication and knowledge sharing: We have set up a number of\nplatforms, including the aforementioned meetup group, an email list, and a website, to\nmake it easy for members to communicate and share information. This has helped to\ncreate a sense of community within the network.\nPrioritizing funding opportunities: We have actively sought out and applied for funding\nopportunities to support the research projects and events of our members. This has not\nonly provided financial resources, but also helped to create a sense of shared\ninvestment in the network's success.\nEncourage the formation of sub-groups: Through the formation of sub-groups which\nwork together on specific research area/output this helped members work together in\nmore focused area of work and get to know each other on a deeper level and make real-\nworld impact.\nTo continue beyond the lifetime of the Action, we plan to establish a permanent\nplatform for our members to connect and collaborate on future projects.

      "final_proof": "Our COST Action CA19130 has become one of the largest and most active COST\nActions in all of Europe. Our network comprises 49 countries globally, of which 39 are\nEuropean COST countries. We have more than 260 working group members now, with\nalmost all countries represented in each working group.\nOur network is cooperating in many different ways and a substantial number of\n(changing) subgroups have formed that work on joint publications, research\napplications and output. We have initiated a meetup group,\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Fintech_AI_in_Finance/, with now more than 2000 members\nglobally. Our more than 150 events so far have been attended by more than 7000\nparticipants.\nTo achieve this, we have implemented several strategies:\nEncouraging active participation from all members: We have made it a priority to ensure\nthat all members are actively engaged in the network and have opportunities to\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nDRAFT\ncontribute to research projects and events. \nPromoting interdisciplinary collaboration: Our network brings together researchers from\na wide range of disciplines, including computer science, economics, finance, and\nmathematics. We have encouraged these researchers to work together on\ninterdisciplinary projects, which has led to a more diverse range of perspectives and\nideas.\nFacilitating communication and knowledge sharing: We have set up a number of\nplatforms, including the aforementioned meetup group, an email list, and a website, to\nmake it easy for members to communicate and share information. This has helped to\ncreate a sense of community within the network.\nPrioritizing funding opportunities: We have actively sought out and applied for funding\nopportunities to support the research projects and events of our members. This has not\nonly provided financial resources, but also helped to create a sense of shared\ninvestment in the network's success.\nEncourage the formation of sub-groups: Through the formation of sub-groups which\nwork together on specific research area/output this helped members work together in\nmore focused area of work and get to know each other on a deeper level and make real-\nworld impact.\nTo continue beyond the lifetime of the Action, we plan to establish a permanent\nplatform for our members to connect and collaborate on future projects. Additionally, we\nwill actively promote the continued collaboration of our subgroups, and will help\nmembers identify funding opportunities to support future research. We will also work to\nestablish long-term partnerships with industry partners, to support the translation of our\nresearch into practical applications.\n \nAll these efforts have contributed to the formation of a strong and resilient network of\nresearchers who are not just working together during the lifetime of the action but will\ncontinue to collaborate on future projects.

Furthermore, these educational programs have provided researchers with an\nunderstanding of the practical applications of the research, which is essential for the\ndevelopment of a joint research agenda.\nBy providing researchers with these opportunities, we have been able to build a\ncommunity around a topic of scientific and socio-economic relevance, allowing for\nknowledge exchange and the development of a joint research agenda (2.a). Our\ncommunity comprising of over 260 working group members now, have represented\nalmost all countries, and worked on many different ways and formed a substantial\nnumber of (changing) subgroups, which work on joint publications, research\napplications and output.\nFurthermore, we have also acted as a stakeholder platform or trans-national practice\ncommunity, pertaining to a certain area of socio-economical or societal application, or\nto a certain market sector (2.d). Our research focuses on the financial industry and\nthe development of cutting-edge technology such as Artificial Intelligence and\nBlockchain. By bringing together researchers from various disciplines including finance,\ncomputer science, and economics, we have been able to address the complex\nchallenges facing the industry and provide valuable insights and solutions to regulators\nand practitioners.
