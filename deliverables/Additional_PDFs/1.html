Abstract—Fueled by advances in technology and shifts in
generational values, the market of online peer-to-peer (P2P) plat-
forms is growing prosperously in China. While the development
of this rapidly-evolving industry has stimulated the ﬁnancial
market where traditional banks could not reach, collapses of
well-known platforms due to malpractice, fraud or business
failure are raising great concerns about systemic risk, as troubles
of systemically important platforms may trigger wide range of
failures because of the network of ﬁnancial exposures among the
industry. However, the network of Chinese P2P lending platforms
remains unknown. To ﬁll this vital gap, we performed the ﬁrst
complex network analysis of the Chinese P2P lending platforms
using empirical platform-level data. The network analysis enables
us to detect the systematically important platforms, through
the static importance indicators as well as cascading scheme.
A further grouping analysis presents the different characteristic
of the platform with different importance levels, which in turn
proves the network modeling is able to function effectively in
detecting the systemic important platforms.
Index Terms—P2P lending, network modelling, systemic risk
I. INTRODUCTION
Peer-to-peer (P2P) online lending, namely lending through
Internet, is a hot topic in China. The convenience of com-
pleting all procedures, including the authorization, accounting,
clearing, delivery, etc., through Internet has met people’s re-
quirements in getting loans. With an estimated two thousands
P2P Internet ﬁnance platforms (henceforth denoted as ‘plat-
form) across the country, online P2P service has successfully
connect individual borrowers with lenders. Nearly all market
participants can borrow and lend directly on the Internet with
few information barriers. The number of investors on online
P2P lending platform has increased from 172 thousands in
2014 to 2861 thousands in 2016. While the booming P2P
lending service have contributed to market-driven ﬁnancial
liberalization, it also incorporates multiple problems, from
managers running away to the collapse of platforms in China’s

biggest fraud cases. For example, an Internet P2P lending
platform called Ezubao attracted funds of about 50 billion
yuan (7.6 billion dollars) from 900,000 investors since it set
up in 2014, and ceased to trade in December 2015 because
the company operated as a Ponzi scheme. To avoid that kind
of thing from happening again, China has been exploring the
potential of peer-to-peer regulation for years [1]. Furthermore,
the collapses of well-known platforms due to malpractice,
fraud or business failure [2] are raising great concerns about
systemic risk, as troubles of systemically important platforms
may trigger wide range of failures because of the network of
ﬁnancial exposures among the industry. However, the network
of Chinese P2P lending platforms remains unknown.
To ﬁll this vital gap, we performed the ﬁrst complex network
analysis (to the best of our knowledge) of the Chinese P2P
lending platforms using empirical platform-level data. We
argue that platforms with overlapped consumers, identical
business models or congruent corporate controls would have
correlative performance and thus can be connected in the
established network of P2P market. Therefore, the connections
among the platforms could be their similarity of operating
performance. In this paper, eleven indictors of operating per-
formance are carefully collected from P2P lending platforms,
such as transaction volume, number of investors, number
of borrowers, average interest rate, and so on at monthly
frequency. The dataset possesses a sample size of 691, and
the sampling period starts from March 2016 to February 2017,
which makes it a well-representative sample to investigate the
P2P platforms system. We establish the distance matrix of the
P2P platform’s network by dynamic time warping (DTW), as
the observations of each platform varies. Based on the network
of P2P platforms, we pick out those that are ‘important’ to the
network system using the language of network science, such
as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, etc. [3]. Detecting
the systemically important platforms in advance, the regulation
department could take precautions against the collapsing of


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 2"></div><pre class="text-content">
them to avoid tremendous lossesand that’s good for investors,
borrowers, and the companies themselves.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
reviews the related works in recent years and further point
out our motivations. The data sets are detailedly introduced in
Section III. Section IV depicts our presenting approaches for
networking method, and the importance indicators including
degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality,
eigenvalue centrality, and a cascading scheme based indicator.
Section V shows the systemic important platforms under
different important measures, and a further grouping analysis
presents the different characteristic of the platforms with
different importance level. Finally we brieﬂy conclude the
paper and review the limitations in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORKS
The studies in the ﬁeld of P2P online lending in China
mainly focus on the business model [4], [5], regulation manner
[1], the detection of individual fraud cases [6]. There are few
that pay attention to the systemic risk among P2P online
platforms. Recent studies in banking systems and ﬁnancial
systems take rather different account of systemic risk. Instead
of focusing on the individual institution intending to minimize
risk and maximize proﬁt, more attention was paid to the
potential effects on the system-wide stability [7]–[12]. On
one hand, the collapses of well-known platforms are raising
great concerns about systemic risk, as troubles of systemically
important platforms may trigger wide range of failures because
of the network of ﬁnancial exposures among the industry. On
the other hand, detecting the systemically important platforms
in advance will beneﬁt the regulation department for taking
precautions against the collapsing of them to avoid tremendous
losses.
III. DATA SETS
From the beginning of 2016, we have kept record Internet
ﬁnance platforms operating performance data from WDZJ
(The data source website is http://www.wdzj.com/.), the most
powerful third-party information web portals of Internet ﬁ-
nance platforms. In this paper, the sampling period starts
from March 2016 to February 2017, covering 691 online
ﬁnance platforms. The collected data contains 11 indicators
of operation performance, shown in Table I.
Note that the data is not a complete records of all the
investigated Internet ﬁnance platforms for the following two
reasons: (1) as most of the online ﬁnance platform are not
listed company, they have no obligation to public consecutive
operating performance data. The most extreme case is that
some platforms just appear once in the whole dataset, pro-
viding only one-month information; (2) some platforms get
into trouble and become a so-called ‘problematic platform’.
The platform will then be closed so the subsequent data are
missing. Fig. 1 shows the frequency that platforms appear
in our dataset. In addition, it should be noted that there are
5761 records on 634 all-time normal platforms while only
216 records of 58 problematic platforms. In preparation, once
the platform become a problematic one, all the records of
it will be labeled as problematic. For the convenience to be
aware of the difference availability for the normal platforms
and problematic platforms, frequency histograms are drawn
separately in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. Histogram of platforms contained in the data set.
As can be seen from Fig. 1, for the normal platforms, there
are over 300 platforms that have a full-sample period records.
However, a half of the problematic platforms are available only
once, either in the month that it is announced as the ‘problem
or in one of the former months. The above data descriptions
stress that the data is severely imbalanced between normal
and problematic platforms, and has a limitation in censoring.
Modeling with the data should consider both of the concerns.
IV. MODELING METHOD
A. Distance matrix
The whole procedure to create the distance matrix for the
P2P platforms is shown in Fig. 2. The details of each step is
given below.

1) Dynamic time warping distance for every indicator: To
deal with the ‘imbalance’ of lengths for the sample platforms’
observations that has been discussed in the previous section,
we considering using dynamic time warping (DTW) to ob-
tain the distance between platforms. In time series analysis,
dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for
measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which
may vary in length. The method started being used by the

data mining community to overcome some of the limitations
associated with the Euclidean distance [13]. In a word, DTW
is a dissimilarity measurement based on the shapes of time
series [14]. The sequences are ”warped” non-linearly in the
time dimension to determine a measure of their similarity inde-
pendent of certain non-linear variations in the time dimension.
Considering x and y as the input series, where x has length
of n and y has length of m. The ﬁrst step in DTW involves
creating a local cost matrix lcmn×m, which is created for
every pair of distances compared. The elements in lcmn×m
for x and y are obtained by
lcmij = (

v
|xv
i −yv
j |p)1/p.
(1)
The second step in DTW involves ﬁnding the path that
minimizes the alignment between x and y by iteratively
stepping through the lcm. In each round of the procedure,
the algorithm ﬁnd the direction that cost increases the least.
Denote φ = {(1, 1), ..., (n, m)} as the set containing all the
points that fall on the optimum path, then the ﬁnal distance
would be computed by
DTWp(x, y) = (
 mφlcm(k)p
Mφ
)1/p, ∀k ∈φ,
(2)
where mφ is a per-step weighting coefﬁcient and Mφ is
the corresponding normalization constant. The way that the
algorithm traverses through the lcm is primarily dictated by
the chosen step pattern. The step pattern is a local constraint
that determines which directions are allowed when moving
ahead in the lcm as the cost is being aggregated, as well as
the associated per-step weights. In this paper, we are using the
TSdist package in R to determine the DTW distance among
the time series.
2) Standardized distance matrix for every indicator: By
applying dynamic time warping method, the distance matrix
of each indicator is obtained. That is, we have eleven distance
matrices in total. To eliminate the scale effect, we apply stan-
dardization for every distance matrix of the eleven indicators
as follows. The elements in one weight matrix are scaled by
the maximum and minimum of the weight matrix, as shown
in equation (3).
wij =
wij −min(wij)
max(wij) −min(wij).
(3)
3) Weighting the distance matrices: As the eleven in-
dicators yield eleven distance matrices, it is necessary to
aggregated them in to a single distance matrix according
to the importance of indicators. In the dataset, we have
status indicating whether the platform is a good platform
or a problematic one. Therefore, we could use status as the
label of the platform to learn which operating performance
indicator is more important to the status of the platform.
The issue is then converted to classiﬁcation modeling. There
are lots of classiﬁcation methods available to deal with our
scenario. Speciﬁcally, we use the Extra-Tree method (standing
for extremely randomized trees) [15] since the algorithm is
computational efﬁciency and of high accuracy.
The input features of the Extra-Tree classiﬁer is the eleven
indicators of operation performance and the label of the Extra-
Tree classiﬁer is status, which is a dummy variable, with 1 as
problematic platform and 0 as good platform. One of the clas-
siﬁer’s outputs that is of our interest is the eleven coefﬁcients
for indicators. The coefﬁcients are the feature importance
measurement that we are looking for. More algorithm related
details of Extra-Tree method could be found in Geurts (2006)
[15]. In this paper, we use the sklearn package in Python
to conduct the procedure. The feature coefﬁcients (weights for
the distance matrices) are shown in the last column of Table
I. We then applied weighs to the eleven standardized distance
matrices by feature selection coefﬁcients in order to produce
accurate estimates of the platforms similarities.
4) The distance distribution: After weighting the eleven
distance matrices, we aggregate them into a single distance
matrix. The distribution of the aggregated distance is shown in
Fig. 3, which exhibits obvious right skewness. This indicates


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 4"></div><pre class="text-content">
that most platforms are similar in the aspects of operating
performances as their distance to each other are low, while
some deviate from others as they has long distance from other.
Fig. 3. The distance distribution.
B. Networking method
The network is formed according to the aggregated distance
matrix. To neglect those unimportant edges while keep the
network connected, we use minimum spanning tree(MST) to
extract the bone of the network. This technique has been
applied in previous studies and achieve well-deﬁned results
[16]–[19]. After the MST extraction, the network possesses
691 nodes and 690 edges, as shown in Fig. 4.
Fig. 4. Network visualization. The size of a node is proportional to its out-
degrees.
Usually, for assortative network, nodes of comparable de-
gree tend to link to each other: small-degree nodes to small-
degree nodes and hubs to hubs. For disassortative networks,
hubs tend to connect to small-degree nodes and small-degree
nodes to hubs. The higher the degree assortativity coefﬁcient,
the more disassortativity the network is. The present network
possesses a degree assortativity coefﬁcient of -0.14, which
means the slightly dissasortativity property.
C. Importance measurements
The importance of nodes in a network have various mea-
surement in different aspects.
1) Degree centrality: It is commonly believed that a node
is important if it has many neighbors. Intuitively, degree
is a simple measure that counts the number of neighbors
a node possess in a graph. Degree centrality considers the
standardization of degree as
DCi =
k
N −1,
(4)
where k is the degree of node i and N is the number of nodes
of the graph. We argue that the collapse of node with high
degree will bring about risk to those platforms that connected
to the it.
2) Betweeness centrality: Betweenness centrality measures
the centrality of a node based on shortest paths [20]. For every
pair of vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one
shortest path between the vertices such that either the number
of edges that the path passes through (for unweighted graphs)
or the sum of the weights of the edges (for weighted graphs) is
minimized. The betweenness centrality for each vertex is the
number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex.
Denote gst as the number of shortest path from node s to t,
among which there are ni
st paths that go through node i. The
betweeness centrality is deﬁned as
BCi =

s̸=i̸=j
ni
st
gst
,
(5)
3) Closeness: In a connected graph, closeness of a node is
also a measure of centrality in a network, calculated as the
sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and
all other nodes in the graph. Thus the more central a node is,
the closer it is to all other nodes. It was deﬁned by [21] as
CCi = 1
di
=
N
N
j=1 dij
,
(6)
where dij is the distance between node i and node j, and di
is the average distance of the paths from node i to other nodes
in the network.
4) Eigenvector centrality: Unlike the previous measures of
centrality, the eigenvectior centrality accounts for the node’s
importance as well as its neighbors’. Denote the adjacency
matrix of the graph as A = (aij). The relative eigenvector
centrality of node i can be deﬁned as
ECi = c
N

j=1
aijxj
(7)
where c is a constance.


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 5"></div><pre class="text-content">
One could solve the corresponding eigenvector equation
Ax = cx to obtain the ECi. This measure has inspired many
follow-up useful indicators such as Google’s PageRank and
the Katz centrality [22].
5) SIR based importance: An SIR model is an epidemi-
ological model that was proposed to explain the rapid rise
and fall in the number of infected patients observed in epi-
demics [23]. This model is reasonably predictive for infectious
diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and
where recovery confers lasting resistance. A network-based
SIR model assumes that the infection only happen to those
who connected to the nodes with disease. For a speciﬁc disease
in a speciﬁc population, these functions may be worked out
in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under
control.
In our scenario, the network of P2P platforms have already
demonstrated the interplays among platforms. Our aim is to
measure the extent of cascading effect for a given platform’s
collapse. We design the following simulation procedure the
get, what we call it ‘SIR based importance’.

Denote N as the total number of nodes, S as the number
of susceptible nodes, I for the number of infectious
nodes, and R for the number of recovered nodes. At the
beginning, one node is chose to be infected, or say, one
platform is collapsed. Set the time as t = 0.
• Step2: Collapse spreading.
The collapsed node would spread ‘disease’ to its neigh-
bors. Denote the infection strength as b, where b ∈[0, 1].
For each neighbor, generate a random number a from
the uniform distribution a ∼U(0, 1), and if a &lt; b, the
neighbor is infected. Otherwise, it is still susceptible. Set
the time as t = t + 1 after the one-hop cascading.
• Step3: Platform recovering.
Denote the recovering strength as g. For every infected
platform, a speciﬁc recovering time r is assigned to it,
where r is generated from exponential distribution r ∼
exp(g). And when the simulation come to time t+r, the
infected node will be set as recovered. Once the node is
recovered, it would not be infected again.
• Step4: Update S, I, R.
Count the numbers of susceptible nodes, infected nodes,
and recovered nodes. If there is newly infected node, the
simulation goes on, that is, we jump back to Step 2 as the
newly infected nodes would again spread the ’disease’.
On the contrary, if there’s no more newly infected nodes,
we stop the simulation, and get the SIR-based impor-
tance measure importanceSIR = I/N, that is, the ﬁnal
infection ratio of the system. Then, jump back to Step1
to start another round of simulation with the same initial
collapse. For every initial collapse, the simulation repeats
100 times to get the mean.
A higher importanceSIR indicates the initial collapse of
the platform would bring about a more severe systematic
failure, thus, the platform is more important.
V. RESULTS
To single out the P2P platforms that are systemically
important, four centrality measures DC, BC, CC, EC, that
reﬂect different aspects of importance are computed, as well
as one index formed by cascading regime, which we call it
importanceSIR. We rank the platforms by the order from im-
portant to unimportant for the ﬁve importance measurements,
respectively, as shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5. Nodes importance of online P2P platforms revealed by ﬁve indicators.
In Fig 5, each column represents one indicator, as where
each row represents one platform. The lighter the color is, the
more importance the platform is. The left side of Fig 5 shows
the hierarchy clustering results using the Euclidean distance
of the ﬁve importance measurement. The basic process of
hierarchical clustering (deﬁned by S.C. Johnson in 1967 [24])
is that 1) Start by assigning each item to a cluster. We have
691 platforms, so now there are 691 clusters, each containing
just one item. 2) Find the closest (the least Euclidean distance)
pair of clusters and merge them into a single cluster, so that
there are one cluster less. 3) Compute the Euclidean distances
between the new cluster and each of the old clusters. 4) Repeat
steps 2) and 3) until all items are clustered into a single cluster
of size 691. To make the clustering results clear, we extract
the clustering results and present it in Fig. 6.
Without the loss of generality, we cut the clustering tree with
groups to be ﬁve. The ﬁve groups are exhibited in different
colors. From left to right in Fig. 6, we call them ‘green group’,
‘red group’, ‘blue group’, ‘purple group’, and ‘yellow group’.
The operating performances of the four groups are shown
in Fig. 7 (the blue group is rather small), with color being
accordance with the names of the groups.

Fig. 6. Cluster.
As can be seen in Fig. 6 and Fig. 5, the green group are
those with least importance (rank over 400) in every aspect
of importance measurements. The green group possesses 138
platforms, with 10 of them are problematic. In Fig. 7(d), we
ﬁnd that these platforms act at the average level in most
operating dimensions, while possess higher average amount
of money from borrowers (ave out) and average amount of
money from lenders (ave in).
The red group is similar with the green group in DC and
BC, implying that they both have low degrees and connections
in the platforms network. However, the red group is of higher
importance in aspects of CC, EC, importanceSIR. This
indicates that those platforms may connected to those of high
importance. The red group possesses 194 platforms, with 24 of
them are problematic. Fig. 7(b) shows that the blue group of
platforms has obvious higher number of underlying lending
proposals(out num) and number of borrowers(out per) than
the average level.
Moving on to the purple groups, it is shown in Fig. 5
that the group is of high importance in every aspect of
importance measurement, whereas the radar plot of Fig. 7(c)
tells that the purple group has lower values in average amount
of money from lenders (ave in), average amount of money
from borrowers(ave out), number of underlying lending pro-
posals(out num), number of borrowers(out per). The purple
group possesses 166 platforms, with 22 of them are problem-
atic.
Last but not the least, the yellow group which has high
importance evaluations in DC and BC, however, has low
importance evaluations in CC, EC, importanceSIR. The
yellow group (Fig. 7(a) ) behaves abnormal in transaction
volume (volumn), number of borrowers(out per), number of
underlying lending proposals(out num). It possesses 138 plat-
forms, with 10 of them are problematic.
On the top of the four groups, the purple group is the most
importance one, given the leading status in the importance
measurements of the platform network. Tracing back to the
operating performance indicators, it is further shown that the
purple group has the most abnormal behaviors in several
operating indicators. Speciﬁcally, it possesses lower ‘energy’
in lending and borrowing activities going on the group’s
platforms, implying these platforms may suffer from ill-run
problems so that few borrowers seeking money and few lend-
ing proposal could not be fulﬁlled. The further investigation
of the proportion of problematic platforms in every group also
shows that the purple group has the highest ratio. This in turn
has proved that the capacity of the ﬁve importance indicators in
detecting the systematic important and problematic platforms.

level of 691 platforms.
VI. CONCLUSION
Our approach of similarity measures plus network analysis
provides a mean of detecting ‘systemically important P2P plat-
forms. Overall, two main ﬁndings are disclosed in our results.
Firstly, a small group of platforms have priority in every angle
of importance, and some only domain in one or two indicators
and, secondly, when looking close to those ‘important nodes,
it is shown that they have abnormal operation performance.
This study inevitably has limitations, for example, whether
the systemic important measurements could work in prediction
is still not investigated because the limitation of longitude
of observation period. Nevertheless, our results could help to
offer investing advice to investors and regulating priority for
macro prudential supervision.
