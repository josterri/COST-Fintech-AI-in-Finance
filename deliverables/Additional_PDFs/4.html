Although financial fraud detection research has made impressive progress because of advanced machine 
learning algorithms, constructing features (or attributes) that can effectively signal fraudulent behaviors 
remains a challenge. In recent years, a new type of fraud has emerged on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending 
platforms, where individuals can borrow money from others without a financial intermediary. In these 
markets, the information asymmetry problem is seriously elevated. Inspired by the fraud triangle theory 
and its extensions, and using the design science research methodology, we construct five categories of 
behavioral features directly from P2P lending transaction data, in addition to the baseline features 
regarding borrowers and loan requests. These behavioral features are intended to capture the fraud 
capability, integrity, and opportunity of fraudsters based on their loan requests and payment histories, 
connected peers, bidding process characteristics, and activity sequences. Using datasets from real users 
on two large P2P lending platforms in China, our evaluation results show that combining these additional 
features with the baseline features significantly enhances detection performance. This design science 
research contributes novel knowledge to the financial fraud detection literature and practice.

Introduction 
Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending markets are usually hosted on 
online platforms, where individuals can acquire loans directly 
from strangers at arm’s length without using an intermediate 
financial institution (e.g., a bank). In the United States, the two

largest P2P platforms, Prosper and Lending Club, have 
facilitated a total of more than $78 billion in loans. In China, 
more than 6,600 P2P platforms have been launched as of 
2021, originating approximately ¥9 trillion (approximately 
$1.4 trillion) loans (Forward View, 2021).

P2P loan fraud occurs when a borrower deliberately creates a 
loan request to cheat lenders out of their money. To protect 
lenders from financial losses and ensure the orderly 
functioning of P2P lending markets, effective fraud detection 
measures must be developed. However, such a task is 
challenging. First, the information asymmetry problem 
(Akerlof, 1970) is seriously elevated in P2P lending markets. 
Unlike banks and other financial institutions, P2P platforms 
and individual lenders can only access very limited 
information about a borrower’s background, financial status, 
and credibility. It is very difficult to find indicators for 
fraudulent loans with incomplete information. Second, scant 
research has been conducted on fraud detection in the context 
of P2P lending. Previous studies on the detection of traditional 
fraud (e.g., credit card fraud and corporate fraud) offer limited 
guidance for this relatively new phenomenon. Although fraud 
always involves some sort of information manipulation, 
specific fraudulent behaviors may be quite complex by nature 
and may vary significantly from domain to domain, and even 
from case to case. With the exception of domain-independent 
techniques such as statistical and machine learning 
algorithms, features2 that can be used for fraud detection 
remain highly domain specific (Vlasselaer et al., 2017). For 
example, features that capture individuals’ purchase patterns 
in credit card fraud detection (Bahnesen et al., 2016) are 
completely irrelevant to the detection of financial fraud in 
corporations, which needs to rely on various organizational 
and industry-level financial indices (Abbasi et al., 2012). 
Therefore, features that are effective in fraud detection in 
some domains are not necessarily useful for and directly 
applicable to P2P loan fraud detection. Unfortunately, no 
guidelines exist in the literature for feature construction for 
P2P loan fraud detection.  
In this research, we propose five categories of behavioral 
features, in addition to baseline features (e.g., borrower 
demographics and loan interest rate). These behavioral 
features are related to some of the fraud antecedents and 
factors identified in the fraud triangle theory and its extensions 
(Albrecht et al., 2006; Cressey, 1953; Wolfe &amp; Hermanson, 
2004), and can be used to glean more information from 
lending transactions to mitigate information asymmetry. In 
particular, features that capture borrower activity sequences 
have never been used in previous financial fraud detection 
research. The key research question is: Are these proposed 
features effective for detecting fraudulent loan requests in P2P 
lending markets? We tested these features using large datasets 
from two leading P2P platforms in China and found the 
answer to our inquiry to be positive. 
Literature Review 
Financial Fraud Detection 
Research on financial fraud detection has addressed the 
problem from two complementary angles: (1) method and 
algorithm development, and (2) feature identification and 
construction. Because fraud detection is primarily a 
classification problem, a large body of literature has 
focused on the development of effective machine learning 
algorithms (see Table 1). Although these algorithms are 
typically domain independent, the features used in fraud 
detection are usually domain specific. In credit card fraud 
detection, for instance, the feature set often includes a 
customer’s demographic information, socioeconomic 
status, and spending patterns (Bahnesen et al., 2016). In 
corporate fraud detection, organizational and industry-
level features (e.g., asset quality index and gross margin 
index) have been used to boost detection performance 
(Abbasi et al., 2012).  
Fraud is also found in cyberspace (Liao et al., 2017). 
Fraudulent behaviors in online marketplaces (e.g., eBay), 
such as shill bidding, have long been an issue. Shill bidding 
usually occurs in English auctions in which fraudsters 
make spurious bids on an item to artificially drive its final 
price up (Trevathan &amp; Read, 2012). These perpetrators may 
be the sellers themselves or their accomplices. In the e-
commerce literature, features related to the auction process 
have been proposed to distinguish between shill bids and 
legitimate bids (Majadi et al., 2017). 
A common challenge in fraud detection research is the 
skewed class distribution problem, which occurs when there 
are significantly more legitimate instances than fraudulent 
instances in the dataset. To address this problem, many 
financial 
fraud 
detection 
studies 
have 
used 
the 
undersampling approach to create balanced samples by 
randomly drawing the same number of legitimate and 
fraudulent instances from their datasets (see Table 1). The 
drawback of this approach is that classifiers trained on 
balanced samples often perform poorly when used to classify 
imbalanced samples (He &amp; Garcia, 2009). Table 1 
summarizes the feature sets, classification methods (and/or 
algorithms), datasets, and performance metrics in recent 
exemplary studies in the financial fraud detection literature. 
 
2 Features are attributes (or variables) that describe the properties or 
characteristics of the phenomenon under study.

P2P Loan Fraud 
A lending transaction typically starts with a user (borrower) 
creating a loan request (listing). The borrower must specify the 
borrowing amount and the interest rate they are willing to pay. 
Once approved by the platform, the listing is open for auction, 
during which other users (lenders) bid on the listing by making 
a pledge to contribute a certain amount. An auction typically 
remains active for several days. The listing is eligible to be 
materialized into a loan if it is successfully funded by the 
auction closure time. Each loan has a repayment term of up to 
36 months, during which the borrower must make monthly 
payments according to the repayment schedule. A loan is 
considered to be in default if it is late for three or more months.  
The risk of P2P loan fraud is rooted to a large extent in the very 
nature of P2P transactions. In the absence of financial 
intermediaries, the problem of information asymmetry 
(Akerlof, 1970) is substantially worsened. In traditional lending 
transactions (e.g., mortgage and automobile loans), the lender is 
typically a financial institution. With access to comprehensive 
records of a borrower’s information (e.g., identity, income, and 
credit history), an institutional lender can often effectively 
predict the borrower’s credibility and financial status. In the 
P2P context, however, lenders are individuals who do not have

access to information about a borrower’s identity and credit 
history. A P2P platform, as an informational rather than 
financial intermediary, also has limited authority and privilege 
to obtain and verify a borrower’s financial status. Consequently, 
individual lenders are highly vulnerable to loan fraud. 
Moreover, in countries such as China—which has no mature, 
nationwide credit system—measures such as credit scores may 
not be readily available for lenders to assess a borrower’s 
credibility (Xu et al., 2015).  
Fraud Triangle Theory and Extensions 
Behavioral theories about fraud are generally lacking in the 
literature. The fraud triangle theory in the accounting and 
auditing literature identifies the conditions and antecedents for 
white-collar crimes. It posits that an individual may commit 
fraud when three conditions are present: perceived pressure, 
opportunity, and rationalization (Cressey, 1953). The perceived 
pressure can be financial (e.g., debts and credit crisis), personal 
(e.g., greed and lack of personal discipline), or social (e.g., 
employer expectations). Opportunity exists when there are 
weaknesses in the control, governance, or regulation systems. 
Rationalization is the perpetrator’s self-justification for the 
offense. The fraud diamond model extends the fraud triangle by 
including a fourth element, that is, capability, to stress the 
importance of the traits, skills, or abilities that an offender must 
possess to be able to commit fraud (Wolfe &amp; Hermanson, 
2004). Other extensions of the fraud triangle theory include the 
following: the fraud scale model, which proposes using 
personal integrity instead of rationalization when investigating 
financial statement fraud (Albrecht et al., 2006); the MICE 
model, which decomposes pressure into money, ideology, 
coercion, and ego (Kranacher et al., 2011); and the SCORE 
model, which uses stimulus as an alternative factor for pressure 
(Vousinas, 2019). Overall, these models focus on four types of 
conditions and antecedents: pressure, opportunity, integrity (or 
self-rationalization), and capability.  
Researchers have pointed out that these fraud models are useful 
for gathering prosecutorial evidence during post-offense 
investigations (Dorminey et al., 2012) or assessing fraud risks 
in fraud prevention, but are inadequate for fraud detection 
(Vousinas, 2019). They are primarily explanatory models that 
identify the reasons why individuals commit fraud, but not 
predictive models per se. As explanatory modeling and 
predictive modeling often have different goals and focuses 
(Shmueli &amp; Koppius, 2011), the fraud triangle theory and its 
extensions are not necessarily directly applicable to predictive 
fraud detection. For example, self-rationalization is typically 
unobservable from the investigator’s perspective and cannot be 
used to predict fraud in practice (Dorminey et al., 2012; Kassem 
&amp; Higson, 2012; Vousinas, 2019). Despite this, these models 
may aid in the search for investigative leads and informational 
cues. For example, auditing professionals and regulators often 
assess the opportunities and capabilities of individuals or 
organizations for corporate fraud investigation and detection 
(Free &amp; Murphy, 2015).  
Our design and development of the behavioral features in this 
research are inspired by the fraud triangle theory and its 
extensions. Because observing and operationalizing the 
factors related to the pressure perceived by individual 
borrowers is fairly difficult in the context of our study, we 
propose features that relate to a borrower’s capability, 
integrity, and opportunity to enhance detection performance. 
Note that pressure is not always unobservable in all contexts. 
For example, if available, the debt-to-income ratio can be a 
good indicator of perceived pressure. 
P2P Loan Fraud Detection 
We developed our P2P fraud detection artifact using the 
design science methodology (Hevner et al., 2004). Figure 1 
presents the fraud detection process, which comprises data 
preparation, feature construction, training, and testing. During 
the first step (data preparation), empirical data are collected 
and preprocessed to create clean, labeled samples for 
supervised learning.  
Feature Construction 
Feature construction is the process of developing new 
attributes from raw data (Zheng &amp; Casari, 2018). High-quality 
features can effectively capture the characteristics of the 
phenomenon under study. Hence, feature construction is a 
critical step in many machine learning tasks and often directly 
affects performance (Bahnesen et al., 2016; Ghaddar &amp; 
Naoum-Sawaya, 2018). In P2P lending markets, the 
borrowers’ demographic information (e.g., age and gender) 
and lending transaction attributes (e.g., borrowing amount and 
interest) are directly available, forming a set of baseline 
features. However, these baseline features are inadequate for 
capturing all the complex characteristics of loan transactions 
and the borrowers’ behavioral characteristics. As a result, we 
identify and construct additional features to help detect 
fraudulent listings. In this research, we propose five additional 
categories of features: borrowing history, payment history, 
connected peers, bidding process characteristics, and activity 
sequence. These features are intended to reveal the capability, 
integrity, and opportunity of fraudsters based on the fraud 
triangle theory and its extensions (Albrecht et al., 2006; 
Cressey, 1953; Wolfe &amp; Hermanson, 2004).

Figure 1. P2P Loan Fraud Detection Process 
 
Borrowing History 
From the perspective of a fraudster, the ultimate goal is to obtain 
as much money as possible with minimum costs. To commit 
fraud, a fraudster must have the skills and capabilities to get 
their listings funded. To learn and practice these skills and 
capabilities, the fraudster needs to test the waters and gain 
experience before committing any fraud. However, it is often 
difficult for a first-time user to successfully have a listing 
funded on a platform (Duarte et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2013; 
Zhang &amp; Liu, 2012). Therefore, a fraudster may need to create 
a few listings and experiment with different parameter values 
(e.g., borrowing amount and interest rate) to learn the “best 
practices.” Conversely, a large number of test listings can 
appear suspicious and reduce the chances of funding success. 
Moreover, if a test listing happens to be fully funded and 
materialized, the borrower must repay it with interest, thereby 
incurring extra costs. Therefore, we believe that features that 
capture a user’s borrowing history can serve as indicators for 
fraud capability (not repayment capability). For each listing 
created by a borrower, we use four features to summarize the 
borrower’s prior loan request activities: n_prior_listings, 
amt_prior_listings, 
n_prior_materialized_loans, 
and 
amt_prior_materialized_loans.3 The definitions of these 
features can be found in Table 2.  
Payment History 
Although the true integrity traits of an individual are not directly 
accessible, a poor track record can be a red flag for a borrower’s 
trustworthiness. We use four features to profile the payment 
history of a borrower (see Table 2): n_prior_repaid_loans, 
 
3 We also used relative values (e.g., percentages) and the results were 
largely the same.  
amt_prior_repaid_loans, 
n_prior_delinquencies, 
and 
amt_prior_delinquencies.  
Connected Peers 
Previous studies have reported that an individual’s social 
network can, to a certain extent, affect their capability of 
getting a loan funded in P2P markets. For instance, 
endorsements made by a borrower’s friends may serve as a 
quality signal and enhance the odds of funding success (Lin et 
al., 2013). Fraudsters may purposefully request or even hire 
their friends to bid on their listings to increase the number of 
endorsements and amount of support.  
However, because of online user anonymity, identifying a 
user’s friends is very difficult in practice. In our study, we 
constructed a network of users in which a link was created 
between a borrower and a lender if the lender had ever made 
a bid on the borrower’s listings. We then counted the 
frequency of links between each pair of borrowers and 
lenders. A high-frequency value indicates that the lender has 
repeatedly bid on that particular borrower’s multiple listings. 
By plotting the link frequency against the number of links with 
the frequency, we found that the power-law distribution curve 
drops dramatically when the frequency is greater than five. 
Specifically, 99.5% of the links have a frequency lower than 
five, and only 0.5% of the borrower-lender links reoccur five 
or more times. We thus define a borrower’s (frequently) 
connected peer as a lender who has bid on five or more of the 
borrower’s listings. In this study, we propose three features 
based on a borrower’s connections (see Table 2): 
borrower_degree, n_by_peers, and amt_by_peers.

4 The interest rate, borrowing amount, and term are all distributed very unevenly. For example, the term of 48% of the listings is 12 months. Consequently, 
dividing a subattribute’s values (e.g., 2-36 months) into five equal intervals may cause the majority of listings to be placed into a single bin (e.g., the bin 
containing all listings with terms of 10-16 months) and to receive the same code. Using five evenly distributed percentiles (i.e., 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 
100%) does not resolve the problem either because many data points take on exactly the same value. As a result, for each subattribute, we use bins of different 
widths to make the resulting distribution (histogram) as even as possible.

Bidding Process Characteristics 
Fraudsters may not only take advantage of existing 
opportunities in the marketplace (e.g., information 
asymmetry and weaknesses in the governance systems) but 
also deliberately create opportunities for fraud by 
manipulating the bidding process. On P2P platforms, lenders 
are more likely to invest in listings that have already received 
bids from others, which is a behavior called herding 
(Berkovich, 2011; Burtch, 2011; Lee &amp; Lee, 2012; Zhang 
and Liu, 2012). The first and last periods of loan auctions 
often see large crowds of lenders (Shen et al., 2010). From a 
fraudster’s perspective, if the fraudster can manage to 
initiate herding momentum, the odds of funding success may 
be substantially boosted. To achieve this goal, a fraudster 
may register as a lender using a fake identity or hire other 
people to register as lenders. The fraudster and the 
confederates can then bid on the fraudster’s own listings 
within the first day or hour to stimulate bids from other real 
lenders, thereby creating herding momentum. Similarly, to 
prevent a funding failure at the time of closure, the fraudster 
and the confederates may contribute to the listing in the last 
period (day/hour) to successfully close and materialize it into 
a loan. However, because hiring confederates incurs costs 
(e.g., communication and coordination cost, labor cost, and 
opportunity cost) and increases the risks of being caught, a 
fraudster may not hire an exceptionally large number of 
people to make fake bids. Therefore, the scale of shill 
bidding on P2P platforms may be limited. In this study, we 
propose eight features to measure the herding momentum 
(number of bids and amount of bids) at the beginning (in the 
first hour and on the first day) of a bidding process and in 
periods toward the end of it (in the last hour and on the last 
day). In this category, we also include five additional 
measures that describe the bidding process characteristics 
(e.g., number of bidders and number of days an auction 
remains open). The names and definitions of these 13 
features are provided in Table 2.  
Activity Sequence 
In addition to the 24 numerical features, we also 
constructed a sequence feature to record how a borrower 
learned to increase their fraud capability through a series 
of borrowing and lending practices and activities over time. 
When encoding the past activities of a borrower, we first 
encode each activity as a word, following the method 
proposed by Grbovic and Cheng (2018), and then adopt the 
word2vec approach (Mikolov et al., 2013) to compute the 
word embeddings. Specifically, each word comprises four 
subattributes that describe a past activity of a borrower: 
 
6 Appendices are located at OSF.io. DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/PKA3C. 
activity type, amount, interest rate, and repayment term. 
Each subattribute of the event is represented by a letter 
(e.g., A and B). Continuous attribute values are discretized 
into several bins (e.g., 1, 2, and 3). For instance, a loan of 
¥4,000 (approximately $616) with an interest rate of 12% 
and a 6-month payment term can be encoded as the word 
“A1B3C2D2.” Table 2 provides the coding scheme.  
For each listing, we retrieved all the borrowing and lending 
activities that the listing borrower had been involved in 
prior to the present listing. Each activity is coded as a word, 
and the sequence of these words forms a sentence. The 
sentence is then used as the sequence feature for the listing 
and fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural 
network. We posit that because the sequence feature 
encodes more information about the activity history of a 
borrower, it can help further improve the detection 
performance. 
Learning and Testing 
In fraud detection applications, the costs of false positive 
(FP) errors and false negative (FN) errors are different for 
different types of stakeholders (Abbasi et al., 2012). 
Although mistakenly classifying a legitimate instance as 
fraudulent (an FP error) may incur unnecessary investigation 
and audit expenses, failing to signal a fraudulent instance (an 
FN error) results in significantly larger losses to victims. 
Therefore, in fraud detection, FN errors are considered 
costlier than FP errors. However, many classification 
algorithms assume equally important classes and treat the 
two types of errors equally. In our research, we used a cost-
sensitive learning strategy to impose a higher penalty on FN 
errors than on FP errors (Elkan, 2001). The higher the FN-
to-FP ratio, the more instances the cost-sensitive learning 
algorithm classifies as fraudulent.  
The classification algorithms we use in this research are 
four state-of-the-art machine learning methods: random 
forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), deep neural network (DNN), 
and LSTM. RF and XGB are decision tree-based 
algorithms, 
and 
both 
have 
achieved 
outstanding 
performance in classification applications (Bhattacharyya 
et al., 2011; Chen &amp; Guestrin, 2016). DNN and LSTM are 
neural 
network 
algorithms 
with 
deep 
learning 
architectures, and LSTM is particularly effective for 
capturing relationships and patterns embedded in 
sequences (Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997). Appendix 
A6 provides descriptions of the architectures of the DNN 
and LSTM models used in our study.

Evaluation 
Data 
We evaluated the design artifact using empirical data from 
EasyLoans,7 which is one of the largest P2P lending 
platforms in China. Launched in 2007, this platform has 
attracted over 103 million users, and more than ¥178 billion 
(approximately $25 billion) loans have been funded. Users 
borrow money for various reasons, ranging from covering 
travel expenses and paying medical bills to purchasing 
automobiles and funding business startups.  
EasyLoans provided us with a proprietary dataset that 
comprised all 1,406,404 listings made by 922,453 
borrowers on the platform from the platform’s inception in 
June 2007 to December 2014. The sample also contained 
11,254,118 records about all the bids made on listings 
during this period. The largest amount requested was 
¥708,686 ($109,028). The number of loan requests 
skyrocketed in 2014 and accounted for 81.2% of all listings 
in the platform’s history (as of the end of 2014). We 
selected the records in 2014 as our evaluation sample, 
which contained 1,142,739 loan requests made by 828,086 
borrowers in this single year. Approximately 20% (227,479 
of 1,142,739) of the listings were successfully funded (by 
52,452 unique lenders) and materialized into loans, and 
11.2% (25,519 of 227,479) of those loans were in default 
by the time we acquired the dataset.  
Class Labeling 
Although we could directly identify defaulted loans in our 
dataset, we could not simply label all the defaults as fraud. 
A borrower may fail to make a monthly payment on time for 
various 
reasons 
(e.g., 
unemployment 
and 
medical 
emergency). If the borrower eventually repays the loan in 
full, it is very unlikely that the borrower intended to deceive 
or cheat lenders in the first place. To identify true fraud, we 
consulted the blacklist published by EasyLoans on its 
website. 
This 
blacklist 
exposes 
information 
about 
malevolent borrowers, who sternly refused to repay their 
loans even after the platform exhausted all payment 
collection measures at its disposal (e.g., multiple email 
reminders, phone calls, and third-party debt collectors). Each 
entry on this list contained a borrower’s user ID, real name, 
and default amount, in addition to the year in which the 
borrower defaulted. Note that if a borrower defaulted but 
paid off the loan later, the borrower’s entry would have been 
 
7 To protect the platform’s confidentiality, we use a fictitious company 
name.  
removed from this list. As the time when we retrieved the 
blacklist (June 2018) was far beyond the repayment 
deadlines of the latest loans in our dataset (December 31, 
2014), we considered this blacklist to be a fairly accurate list 
of deceitful borrowers on this platform. This assumption was 
also confirmed by the platform.  
Note that a borrower’s presence on the blacklist does not 
necessarily mean that all loan requests made by the borrower 
were fraudulent. We found 3,202 blacklisted borrowers in 
2014 whose total loan amount was more than ¥21 million 
(approximately $3.2 million). For each loan by a blacklisted 
borrower, we carefully examined the loan information (i.e., 
default vs. repaid status, total overdue amount in the data, 
the default amount posted on the blacklist, and the default 
percentage of the borrowing amount). Eventually, we 
identified 3,002 fraudulent loans. This number accounted for 
1.3% (3,002 of 227,479) of all materialized loans and 11.8% 
(3,002 of 25,519) of all defaulted loans in 2014. The class 
distribution was extremely skewed, with a legitimate-to-
fraud ratio as high as 75:1 (224,477:3,002). In this case, 
detecting a small number of fraudulent instances in such a 
large volume of data was like finding a needle in a haystack. 
FN-to-FP Cost Ratios 
To apply the cost-sensitive learning strategy, we estimated 
the costs of classification errors for lenders. If a 
classification algorithm fails to signal a fraudulent loan, an 
FN error occurs. The lenders’ costs included the lost 
principal (average = ¥7,108; approximately $1,093; see the 
statistics in Table C1 in Appendix C on OSF.io) and the 
opportunity cost of not investing in a legitimate loan from 
which they could earn interest (average = 14%). Because 
other costs (e.g., lost time for searching and examining the 
list, and negative emotions caused by the financial losses) 
were intangible and difficult to measure, we did not include 
them in the cost estimation. Therefore, for lenders, the costs 
of an FN error were ¥7,108 + ¥7,108  0.14 = ¥8,103 
(approximately $1,246). In the case of an FP error, in which 
a legitimate request (average = ¥5,334) was mistakenly 
marked as fraudulent, the lenders’ opportunity cost was the 
lost interest that could have been earned: ¥5,334  0.14 = 
¥747 (approximately $115). As a result, the FN-to-FP cost 
ratio was roughly 11:1 for lenders on this platform. Because 
we did not have data about the various costs for the platform 
(e.g., investigation costs) and for legitimate borrowers, we 
could not estimate their cost ratios.

Feature Sets 
Seven baseline features about a borrower’s demographic and 
listing information were directly available in the dataset: age, 
gender, education level, occupation, borrowing amount, 
interest rate, and repayment term. To test the performance of 
the proposed features, we constructed three feature sets: Set A 
(7 baseline features), Set B (7 baseline + 24 numerical 
features), and Set C (7 baseline + 24 numerical + 1 sequence 
features). Although EasyLoans assigned a letter credit grade 
from AAA (high quality) to F (high risk) to each user based 
on the user’s background information (e.g., education level 
and degrees) and previous repayment records on this platform, 
if applicable, the credit grade was an ex post measure in this 
dataset: at the time of our data collection, the platform had 
already lowered the credit grades of the default borrowers 
(including fraudulent borrowers). Therefore, we did not 
include the credit grade in the baseline set. 
Performance Metrics 
As in most supervised machine learning studies, we selected 
accuracy as the first performance metric. However, because 
the sample was extremely imbalanced, with only 1.3% of the 
loans (3,002 of 227,479) labeled as fraudulent, accuracy was 
as high as 98.7%, even without using any features and any 
supervised classifiers (i.e., all the loans are blindly classified 
as legitimate). As a result, we also selected the recall, 
precision, and F score for the fraud class, in addition to 
accuracy, to measure how well a classifier identified 
fraudulent loan requests.

𝑇𝑃+ 𝐹𝑃 
𝐹 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒= 2 × Precision × Recall

In these definitions, TP and TN represent the numbers of true 
positives and true negatives, respectively. As these three 
metrics only correspond to the fraud class, recall is the same 
as sensitivity; that is, the higher the recall, the more sensitive 
the classifier is to detecting fraud within a set of listings. The 
higher the precision, the less likely it is for a classifier to 
mislabel a legitimate listing as fraudulent. The F (or F1) score 
is the harmonic mean between precision and recall and 
provides a balanced view between the two metrics. We also 
report the AUC, which is the area under the receiver operating 
characteristics curve. Generally, the higher the AUC, the more 
capable the classifier is at outperforming random guessing. The 
closer the AUC is to 1.0, the better the classifier.  
Analyses and Results 
Blacklisted versus Legitimate Borrowers 
Our underlying assumption for fraud detection is that 
fraudsters’ characteristics and behaviors deviate from those of 
legitimate borrowers. To confirm this assumption, we first 
compared the means of features between the two groups of 
borrowers by running independent-sample t-tests. Table C1 in 
Appendix C reports the means, standard deviations, and 
statistical significance of the baseline and our proposed 
numerical features. To keep the description and discussion 
straightforward, we express all the monetary amounts in the 
following text in Chinese currency (¥) without converting 
them into U.S. dollars ($).  
With the exception of the interest rate and borrower age, 
blacklisted and legitimate borrowers had significantly 
different characteristics measured by these features (p &lt; 
0.001). For example, on average, the requested loan amount 
per listing by blacklisted borrowers (¥7,108) was significantly 
greater than the amount requested by legitimate borrowers 
(¥5,334). Blacklisted borrowers also had significantly more 
delinquencies (0.21) than legitimate borrowers (0.02). 
The bidding process features reveal drastic differences 
between blacklisted and legitimate borrowers. For instance, 
the number and amount of first-day and first-hour bids, as well 
as those for the last day and last hours, were much higher for 
blacklisted borrowers than for legitimate borrowers.  
Effects of the Skewed Class Distribution 
To investigate how the skewed class distribution affected 
detection performance, we used the undersampling approach, 
which is widely adopted in fraud detection studies (see Table 
1). By randomly removing a number of legitimate instances 
from the original dataset, we constructed a series of samples, 
labeled Samples 1 to 7, with a legitimate-to-fraud ratio of 1:1, 
10:1, 20:1, 30:1, 40:1, 50:1, and 60:1, respectively. Sample 1 
was a completely balanced sample in which only 3,002 
legitimate loans were extracted to match the fraudulent loans, 
and the majority (97.4%) of records were discarded.  
We found that the performance (recall, precision, F score, and 
AUC) of the classifiers continued to deteriorate as the sample 
size increased and the skew of the class distribution worsened. 
Figure B1 in Appendix B (on OSF.io) plots the F scores for 
Samples 1 to 7 and the original dataset using RF with feature 
Sets A (baseline features) and B (baseline + numerical 
features). It shows that when the entire dataset (with a 
legitimate-to-fraud ratio of approximately 75:1) was used, the 


</pre><div class="page-break" data-page="Page 10"></div><pre class="text-content">

1786

F score was very low (0.22 for Set A and 0.33 for Set B). This 
means that as a sample becomes more imbalanced, the 
classifier becomes less capable of correctly distinguishing 
between fraudulent and legitimate loans. The AUC also 
decreased as the legitimate-to-fraud ratio increased. However, 
its accuracy remained high (approximately 0.96 for both 
feature sets), even with the 75:1 ratio. We obtained similar 
results using the XGB and DNN algorithms. As the class 
distribution became more skewed, the performance gap 
between Sets A and B became wider, thereby demonstrating 
the potential of our proposed features.  
Performance of Features 
Following the common practice of financial fraud detection 
research (see Table 1), we first selected Samples 1 and 2—
with legitimate-to-fraud ratios of 1:1 and 10:1, respectively—
when testing classification performance. For each sample, we 
compared the performance between the baseline features (Set 
A) and combinations of the baseline and proposed features 
(Sets B and C). We performed a series of t-tests using the 10-
fold cross-validation approach to establish the statistical 
significance of the performance difference.  
Numerical Features 
We first sought to determine whether the proposed numerical 
features could provide more information about borrower 
behavior in addition to the baseline features. Table 3 reports the 
comparison results between Set A (baseline features) and Set B 
(baseline + numerical features). 
The results show that the overall accuracy using Set B was 
significantly higher than that using Set A across all algorithms. 
In terms of recall (sensitivity to fraud), the performance 
difference between the two sets was not significant; that is, the 
algorithms were very sensitive to fraudulent instances given 
even a small number of baseline features. This is because of the 
use of a cost-sensitive learning strategy that imposed a penalty 
11 times greater on FN errors than on FP errors. Indeed, an 
extremely high FN-to-FP cost ratio could cause an algorithm to 
classify nearly all instances as fraudulent, thereby resulting in a 
very high recall value close to 1.0. However, such a classifier is 
useless because it fails to rule out legitimate cases; that is, high 
recall is at the cost of precision: although most fraudulent 
listings are correctly detected, many red-flagged requests are 
actually legitimate.  
 
8 We did not test the features using LSTM on the original dataset because 
this would have required constructing the sequences from the transaction 
Precision for the fraud class using Set B was significantly 
better than that using Set A. With the imbalanced Sample 2, 
precision dropped below 50%. Although the algorithms erred 
on the side of caution by identifying as many fraudulent 
listings as possible, the FP error rate elevated quickly. Given 
the trade-off between precision and recall, the F score 
provided a more balanced picture. Specifically, Set B’s F 
scores were significantly better than those of Set A, except for 
DNN in Sample 1. The AUC values were also significantly 
higher using Set B than using Set A.  
To summarize, the performance of Set B in terms of accuracy, 
precision, F score, and AUC was significantly better than that 
of Set A. When the sample was perfectly balanced, the 
performance of the two sets was nearly the same. However, 
when the sample was more skewed, the role of our proposed 
numerical features became more important.  
To evaluate the performance of the feature sets in real-world 
applications, we also used the original dataset with a 
legitimate-to-fraud ratio of 75:1. The first two groups of rows 
in Table 4 report the 10-fold cross-validation comparison 
results between Sets A and B using the models learned from 
under-samples on the original dataset. It shows that 
performance deteriorated significantly, particularly for the 
precision and F score. On average, about 94% of the identified 
fraudulent instances were actually legitimate. This is 
consistent with the findings in previous research that models 
learned from samples using the undersampling approach 
perform poorly when applied to real datasets with very 
skewed class distributions (He &amp; Garcia, 2009).  
We then tested the performance of the two feature sets on the 
original sample without undersampling. The last group of rows 
in Table 4 reports the results, which show that Set B consistently 
outperformed Set A across all metrics and algorithms.  
To assess the quality of the features, we performed chi-squared 
tests (see Table C2 in Appendix C) and found that all the 
features were significant (p &lt; 0.001).  
Activity Sequence Feature 
We only used Set C (baseline + numerical + sequence 
features) with the LSTM neural network algorithm, which is 
capable of processing sequence input. To save space, in Table 
5, we only report the comparison results for Set C using LSTM 
against Set B (baseline + numerical features) using DNN, 
which is a neural network without sequence handling.8 
histories for all 224,477 instances, which would have required too much 
time.

In Sample 1, Set C did not perform significantly better than 
Set B. However, in Sample 2, Set C significantly 
outperformed Set B in terms of accuracy, precision, F score, 
and AUC. This implies that in the sample with a balanced 
class distribution (Sample 1), the sequence feature provided 
little additional help, whereas in the sample with a skewed 
distribution (Sample 2), Set C helped improve all the 
metrics, except for recall. Therefore, we believe that the 
combination of all features, including the sequence feature, 
generally outperforms the baseline features (except for 
recall), particularly regarding imbalanced datasets with 
skewed class distributions.  
Generalizability Check 
To ascertain whether the proposed features were generalizable 
to other platforms, we obtained proprietary data from another 
P2P lending platform. Founded in 2010, this platform has 
attracted over 18 million users, with more than ¥63 billion 
(approximately $9.84 billion) of funded loans. The dataset 
provided by this second platform comprised all 795,758 
listings made by 594,481 borrowers from 2010 to 2015. The 
largest amount requested during this period was ¥3,000,000 
(approximately $469,000). In 2015, there was a drastic 
increase in the number of loan requests, accounting for 50.3% 
of all listings in the platform’s history. We selected the records

for 2015 as our experimental dataset, which contained 
400,745 loan requests made by 329,479 borrowers in this 
single year. Among these listings, 114,742 requests were 
funded by 146,308 unique lenders. We identified 1,454 
fraudulent loans, which was 1.26% (1,454 of 114,742) of all 
materialized loans and 77.8% (1,454 of 1,868) of all defaulted 
loans 
in 
2015. 
The 
legitimate-to-fraud 
ratio 
was 
approximately 79:1, and the FN-to-FP cost ratio was 
approximately 5:1 on this platform. Table 6 reports the 
comparison of the all-feature Set C against Set A on a sample 
with a legitimate-to-fraudulent ratio of 10:1. Similar to the 
results from EasyLoans, except for recall, the performance 
using all features was significantly better than that using the 
baseline features alone. 
Discussion 
It has been a challenge in fraud detection research to construct 
effective features for signaling fraudulent behaviors 
(Pourhabibi et al., 2020; Vlasselaer et al., 2017). In this 
research, we proposed a set of features constructed from P2P 
lending transactions to detect loan fraud. Based on the fraud 
triangle theory and its extensions, we identified five categories 
of features that capture the behavioral patterns of loan 
fraudsters, in addition to baseline features. To a certain extent, 
these features reflect a fraudster’s capability of committing 
fraud, personal integrity, and opportunity. Testing these 
features using four state-of-the-art classification algorithms 
(RF, XGB, DNN, and LSTM), we found that these additional 
features enhanced detection performance. Our research has 
important implications for both fraud detection research and 
practice.  
Implications for Research and Practice 
Our research contributes to the literature on fraud theories and 
models. Despite their role in fraud prevention and 
investigation, the fraud triangle theory and its extensions have 
been found to be inadequate for fraud detection (Dorminey et 
al., 2012; Kassem &amp; Higson, 2012; Vousinas, 2019). The five 
categories of behavioral features proposed in our research 
bridge this gap by providing operationalization of the three 
antecedents of fraud (capability, integrity, and opportunity) in 
the P2P lending context, thereby demonstrating these models’ 
potential in assisting fraud detection. Our research also 
broadens and deepens our understanding of fraud conditions 
and manipulation tactics. It shows that fraudsters may exploit 
opportunities in P2P lending markets. Given the information 
asymmetry and identity anonymity on these platforms, 
offenders can engage lenders’ trust by building a track record 
deliberately before committing fraud. They may manipulate 
the bidding process by recruiting shill bidders (Wang et al., 
2002) to create herding momentum during the first or last 
period of a loan auction. 
Furthermore, our research adds to the discussion regarding 
predictive analytics in information systems (IS) research. 
Although theories are usually expected to achieve both 
explanation and prediction, there have been calls to consider 
these two goals separately (Forster, 2002) because 
explanatory modeling seeks to establish causal relationships 
and predictive modeling aims at “predicting new/future 
observations or scenarios” (Shmueli &amp; Koppius, 2011, p. 
555). This raises a question about the role of theory in 
predictive modeling; and, indeed, many predictive analytics 
studies in IS do not connect to any theory (e.g., Ben-Assuli &amp; 
Padman, 2020; Geva et al., 2017). However, we believe that 
although the explanatory power of a theory does not always 
imply predictive power, explanatory theories may still offer 
useful directions and hints for predictive modeling. In our 
research, the fraud models are clearly explanatory, yet they 
helped us identify additional behavioral features to enhance 
predictive performance in P2P fraud detection. 
As a proof of concept, this study provides useful guidance for 
constructing effective features for the practice of P2P lending 
fraud detection. Features used in the detection of traditional 
fraud (e.g., credit card fraud, see Bahnesen et al., 2016; 
corporate fraud, see Abbasi et al., 2012) have limited 
applicability to P2P loan fraud detection. The feature set that 
we propose in this research includes not only “raw” attributes 
about P2P lending transactions, which are similar to those 
used in traditional fraud detection research (e.g., features for 
borrowing and payment history), but also novel features for 
capturing bidding process characteristics and activity 
sequences, which have been seldom or never used in financial 
fraud detection. More importantly, all these features can be 
constructed directly from a P2P lending platform’s historical 
and current data, which makes them readily accessible for a 
platform’s risk control and management. Using appropriate 
machine learning methods with these features, a platform can 
monitor the marketplace and spot suspicious loan requests in 
real time. With these countermeasures, lenders are better 
protected from and less vulnerable to loan fraud; and the 
financial risks of investment are reduced.  
Theoretically, after training and testing, a learned 
classification model can be used in real time to detect 
fraudulent 
transactions. 
In 
practice, 
however, 
some 
implementation issues must be addressed. For instance, some 
of the bidding process-related features (e.g., number of bids in 
the last hour) are not available before the auction closes. Thus, 
a platform must determine when to apply the detection 
methods and how to operationalize the countermeasures.

Although it is most cost-effective for a platform to wait until all 
the features become available, some platforms may wish to 
monitor listings before, during, and after auctions. If a platform 
chooses to act sooner, we recommend a three-stage strategy. 
The first stage occurs after a borrower submits a loan request 
for approval and before the auction starts. At this stage, the 
platform can use features constructed from historical records 
(i.e., borrowing and payment histories) to determine if it is 
legitimate. The second stage occurs after a listing is approved 
and the auction starts. During the auction period, the platform 
can use some of the bidding process features (e.g., number of 
first-day bids) to monitor the auction. The last stage starts 
immediately after the auction is closed and all the bidding 
process-related features become available. The platform can 
suspend the transaction right away if a loan request is red-
flagged at any stage. To use this three-stage strategy, the 
platform can implement a standard policy for a “holding 
period” before, during, and after the auction. This policy allows 
the platform to investigate any suspicious listings and/or request 
additional supporting documents or proof during the holding 
period. In fact, on the two platforms in our study, even if a 
listing is fully funded after the auction, it must be approved 
before it materializes into a loan. If a listing fails to be approved 
by the platform (because of reasons such as shill bidding), the 
listing is rejected, and the lenders’ funds, frozen during the 
bidding, are released back to the lenders. In the case in which a 
loan is found to be fraudulent after it is already materialized and 
the lenders’ funds have already been transferred to the 
borrower, the platform can still protect the lenders to some 
degree. It has been found that the implementations of certain 
low-cost behavioral mechanisms (e.g., sending the borrowers 
text message reminders conveying the lenders’ positive 
expectations) can significantly increase loan repayment rates on 
P2P lending platforms (Du et al., 2020). 
While we are developing advanced methods and approaches to 
fighting fraud, fraudsters are adaptive human beings—they also 
update their tactics, hone their skills, and adjust their strategies. 
Therefore, fraud detection practitioners must keep watching the 
marketplace and continuing to identify emerging patterns, 
changes, and trends to ensure a healthy, orderly investment 
environment.  
Limitations 
This research has several limitations. First, our datasets were 
from single sources, and most of the features were constructed 
based on transaction records. No data from other sources (e.g., 
social media) or of a different nature (e.g., geographical 
locations and IP addresses) were included in our dataset. 
Consequently, the information captured by our proposed 
features was limited, which resulted in moderate recall levels 
(around 50%) in the original datasets. Second, both platforms 
under study are in China, in which the financial environment, 
laws, regulations, and culture are quite different from those in 
other developed and developing countries. Whether our 
proposed features can also be applied to P2P platforms in 
other countries remains to be seen. For example, with the 
availability of credit scores, platforms in other countries may 
be able to better detect fraudulent loans. Third, because we use 
supervised learning models, our approach is only applicable 
to platforms that have already been suffering from fraud; that 
is, the data used for training must have confirmed fraudulent 
instances. New platforms, which do not have rich sets of 
historical records with both legitimate and fraudulent 
transactions, cannot use these supervised learning methods. 
Another potential limitation is that our proposed features rely 
heavily on the past transaction records of borrowers. If a 
borrower is new to a platform and has no previous 
transactions, many of the features (e.g., number of previous 
listings and delinquencies) are zero. This is similar to the 
“cold-start” problem in recommender systems research (Basu 
et al., 1998). In this case, the classification must rely only on 
the baseline and bidding process-related features.  
Conclusion 
To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first few 
groups to study P2P loan fraud empirically. In future work, we 
will construct additional features when data from diverse 
sources and of different natures (e.g., income-to-debt ratio, 
employment history, online purchase records, and social 
media posts) are available and will operationalize other factors 
identified in the fraud theories (e.g., pressure).
