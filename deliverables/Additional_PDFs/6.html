Abstract. A recommender system is an automated collaborative filtering system
that helps users to decide what they are interested in by extracting their own
preferences. Most studies related to recommendation system have focused on
centralized environment causing several serious problems such as fraud rating
and privacy issues. In this paper, however, we propose the distributed recom-
mender system with FOAF on P2P environment. This system can recommend
users without the centralized server, which keeps updating their profiles. In or-
der to find out the most eligible users to be recommended, user grouping (se-
lecting objects) is one of the most important processes in the whole recommen-
dation. Thereby, we have exploited cosine-based similarity method to cluster
the users in the same level. More importantly, RFR (Recommend-Feedback-Re-
recommend) algorithm is suggested to improve the confidence of recommenda-
tion. For the experiment, we have used the MovieLens datasets and have tested
the performance by using “F1-measure&quot; and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). As a
conclusion, we have improved the robustness of the system. Also, we have
shown the possibility of distributed recommender system on semantic web.
1   Introduction
As the Internet infrastructure has been developed, recommender systems have been
issued as one of solutions for information retrieval. A recommender system on E-
commerce and Information retrieval has brought reduction of cost for searching by
extracting information in which users are interested and listing the result that are likely
to fit the user. The computation for recommendation is based on stochastic process
which sparse and incomplete data, so that the result can be either correct or occasion-
ally very wrong [1]. At the same time, in order to recommend some information to
user, the system has to learn the user preference in advance [2] and this causes privacy
issue. These conditions are regarded as a problem that should be solved for modeling
recommender system more efficiently. To solve these problems and to increase the
performance of the recommender system such as robustness, MAE and “F1-measure”,
researchers have suggested a number of alternative approaches using various tech-
niques [3], [4]. We will present some of the researches in next section.

In this paper, we propose a Peer-to-Peer recommender system based on FOAF
(‘Friend Of A Friend’).  Due to the extensibility of the FOAF-based distributed envi-
ronment, it is possible to aggregate information from other users who have the same
interest. User preference is asserted as a property of the FOAF document format by
learning user’s behaviors. Once the system learns user preferences, it can classify
users with respect to their own preferences on real time, and also, it can recommend
items in which users are interested to the rest of them in the same group on P2P net-
work. Furthermore, we can increase the robustness of recommendation using RFR
algorithm that helps users to decide whether the recommendation is reliable or not by
considering other user’s rating results in the same group. Finally, we can get satisfac-
tory result of robustness [5]. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 concen-
trates on the recent and related researches, section 3 refers to the suggesting recom-
mender system based on FOAF and we explain experimental result in section 4. We
conclude this study with the future work in section 5.
2   Related Work
Recommender systems, regarded as a part of personalization technique [4], are mainly
used in personal information systems and E-Commerce to recommend products to
customers. Tapestry is one of the earliest systems of collaborative filtering-based
recommender system [6]. The GroupLens system that developed by research group in
University of Minnesota is based on rating for collaborative filtering of netnews in
order to help people find relevant articles in the huge stream of available articles [7].
This system is also called ratings-based automated recommender system, because
filtering is executed by the explicit opinions of people from a close-knit community
[8].  There is an additional project, MovieLens, which is web-based recommender
system for movies, based on GroupLens technology. They also offer an experimental
data source and a framework for studying user interface issues related to recommender
systems [9]. Meanwhile, there have been many studies to enhance privacy issues. In
[10], John Canny tries to solve privacy problem with security technologies such as key
sharing, encryption and decryption. [11] suggested Local Profile Model to protect
personal profiles by separating personal profiles from centralized server to each user’s
PC. Although it can protect draining of personal profile, but the system is working on
centralized server, so it is still weak in fraud rating and malicious server attack.
3   Distributed Recommender System Based on FOAF
Recently, information integration and standardization on Semantic web environment
have been emerging important field [12]. Many studies have been developed using
RDF and XML. FOAF [13] derived from RDFweb makes users possible to link them-
selves to friend of a friend by using RDF-based document for user profile. When a
user publishes a document for some information with FOAF, machines are able to
make use of that information, and also users can make their own friends’ network by

Conceptual Framework for Recommendation System         117
interlinking FOAF. Our recommender system is based on FOAF under distributed
environment such as P2P to increase recommendation performance. The recommender
system extracts each user’s preference that is represented by FOAF document format.
By the preferences of each user, recommender system groups users. And then, when a
user evaluates an item mi, the system determines whether mi is good enough to rec-
ommend to another users in the same group or not. Once the system decides to rec-
ommend mi to other users, the recommendation is only applied to level n. We can
define the ‘level’ as the depth of friends to be known by the user directly.
3.1   Extracting User Preferences
Before grouping users according to their preferences, the system needs to know about
each user’s preferences. In this paper, as used in MovieLens, we have distinguished
movie genres into 19 categories. Usually a movie can be comprised in more than one
category, at the same time, a user can have more than one preference about movie
genre. We used MovieLens-like strategy to collect users’ taste. Each page shows a list
that consists of movies selected randomly from an ad hoc manual list of popular mov-
ies and the rest randomly from all movies [2]. In order to extract accurate preferences
from each user, we employed a probabilistic method as shown Eq.(1).
Assume there are the set of users U={u1,u2,…,ui}, the set of movies that is rated by
a user ui is M={m1,m2,…,mj} and the set of genre is G={g1,g2,…,gk}. The function
f(Pik) extracts i-th user’s preference about a genre k. This function

where Cm is a set of genres included in a movie mj and Rij means a rating value of i-th
user about a movie mj. Also µ means total count of genres that included in movies that
are rated by a user ui.
3.2   User Grouping on Distributed Environment (Object Selection Procedure)
Distributed recommender system is basically impossible to group users at once. To
enhance this shortcoming, there have been many studies clustering users on real-time
[14]. Because each user’ profile is distributed, the grouping of users must be proc-
essed at the same time with the recommendation. Although it takes more time to group
users compare with centralized system, we can overcome some drawbacks of the sys-
tem. The user grouping (object selection procedure) is processed on real-time, so it
can make distributed system more dynamically, for example, when a new friend is
added on a user or when a user’s preferences are changed, we do not need to update
any part of the system. And the place where users&#x27; information is gathering does not
exist. Therefore, the distributed recommender system is less dependent on environ-
ment than centralized system. It also guarantees users’ privacy [10]. Grouping of users
must be done before recommendation. For the grouping of users, we used cosine-
based similarity that is the most common way to compute the similarity between two

As shown in Eq.(2), the grouping is calculated by the function f(Gi) and it is a
summation of the function S. where, S(a) means a set of similar users of user a who
has preference bigger than threshold Toptimal.
3.3   RFR (Recommend-Feedback-Re-recommend) Recommendation
On the process of a recommendation, a rating can be regarded as an essential factor
for the quality of the system. But, although a user rates an item with good score, we
cannot say the result is reliable, because it is just a user’s subjective opinion. There-
fore, for the quality of recommendation, we need to aggregate same group users’ rat-
ing as many as possible. Therefore we focused on this level. We assume that a level is
a group of a user who has known by a user directly.

Recommended user C1 will take three pieces of information from recommender in
leveln-1. They will be sent by FOAF document involved the name of an item mj, rating
result and the number of rater. The rating result is both a factor that can influence a
recommended user to make their decision and a criterion that can compare with
threshold for recommendation. Once a user rates an mj, the rating result is also sent to
members of leveln+1. We can consider three cases as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Three cases of recommendation process by rating.
In Fig. 1(a), R1 is a rating result from the user C1. If R1 is less than threshold θ, no
recommendation is being made. And in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c), there can be two ac-
tions from the user C2 according to their actions; 1) C2 rates mj, 2) C2 do not rates mj.
In case of 1), the system needs to update the rating result. But the case of 2), the
system only needs to recommend another level. To update rating result on real-time,
we suggested RFR (Recommend-Feedback-Re-recommend) system.
If U1 on level 1 rates an item mj that satisfies with threshold, the system recom-
mends the mj with rating result to C1, C2, and Cn on level 2. Due to the independency
between users, each user on the same level cannot recognize another’s rating result.
To update summarized rating result from all users on P2P network feedback proc-
ess is needed. By this process, U1 will take rating results from users on level 2. Feed-
back is a set of rating result from users, Feedback={Rate(C1),…,Rate(Cn)}. The first
recommender, U1 can calculate the updated rating result after feedback. Then, it will

be re-recommended to C1, C2, and Cn, and these processes are applied to all levels
(Eq.(4)). Therefore, as the level grows the rating result can be more reputable. The
function Re-recommend is formulated as follows:

where N is the number of set of feedback.
4   Experiment
In this section, we analyzed performance of proposed system using “F1-measure” and
MAE. We also examined performance of robustness against malicious action as level
increases. Experiments were carried out on Pentium 1 GHz with 256MB RAM, run-
ning MS-Windows 2000 Server. The recommender system was implemented by Vis-
ual Basic 6.0, Active Server Page (ASP), and IIS 5.0.
4.1   Data Sets
We used MovieLens data sets to experiment suggesting recommendation system.
MovieLens is a web-based research recommender system. The data set contains
1,000,000 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 users
who joined the site in 2000. For the experiment, we selected 450 users to use only
about 66,926 rating dataset [9]. By users’ rating data, we can extract all users’ prefer-
ences. After we got the preferences, we made a matrix of user-user similarity that has
450 rows and 450 columns. Then, we also made the Most Similar Users (MSU) set by
cosine-based similarity method.
4.2   Performance Measure
In this experiment, first of all, we employ “F1-measure” widely used in information
retrieval community to find the optimal threshold Toptimal for user grouping procedure.
As shown in Eq.(5), “F1-measure” is calculated by precision and recall. So we de-
fined precision as the ratio of hit set size to the prediction set size, and recall as ratio
of hit set size to the MSU set size. Whereas, prediction is defined as the set of recom-
mendation generated by the system and hit set is defined as the intersection of predic-
tion set and MSU set which can be written as ‘hit set = prediction set ∩ MSU set’. For
example, if a user u1 recommends an item mj to u2 and u3, we can define prediction set
as ‘prediction (mj)  = {u1 → u2, u1→ u3}’.

4.3   Experimental Results
For the Toptimal of user grouping procedure, we used “F1-measure” with 124 items.
After we made FOAF network, recommended each items to users who are randomly
selected. We carried out the experiment while changing threshold from 0.1 to 1.

Fig. 2. Variation of the F1-measure as changing threshold, Toptimal.
In Fig. 2., when we set threshold to 0.7, it shows the best result, that is, this leads to
the best performance for user grouping (object selection). When any users are recom-
mended on FOAF network, the users propagate the recommendation to their friends
who have similarity that is bigger than 0.7 of threshold.
Then, we have used MAE to show how the accuracy changes as level increase. In
Fig. 3(a), we tested changing values through 6 levels. When we use a data set without
any fraud rating, the result is continuously getting lower than former level, leveln-1.
Since the number of users is exponentially increased as a level increase, the system
can aggregate as many users’ opinion. It means that even there are some of malicious
ratings, users can take more accurate recommendation than centralized system as level
increase. We have also shown the performance of the system in Fig. 3(b) using “F1-
measure” to show robustness. As illustrated in graph, we involved some of malicious
ratings in terms of 10%, 20%, and 30%. Generally, even when malicious ratings are
included, system’s performance is increased as level increase as we already show in
Fig. 3(a). When there is no fraud rating, in Fig. 3(b), the performance evaluated by
“F1-measure” is improved about 9.17%, and in case of 10%, 20%, and 30% of fraud
ratings are included, the performance is improved by 8.02%, 11.35%, and 15.69%
respectively.

Fig. 3. Variant of mean absolute error (MAE) as level increase (a) and system performance
measured by “F1-measure” in case of malicious ratings are included (b).
No matter how many fraud ratings are included in a rating data set, as level in-
crease, the performance is improved 11.68% in terms of the three cases in average.
Especially, when the percentage of fraud rating is increased, we can get more efficient
improvement of the performance. As a result, these three fraud ratings brought only
9.71% of degradation of robustness, compared with original rating set (no fraud rating
set).
5   Conclusions and Future Work
As a growing demand of distributed environment, we suggested P2P collaborative
filtering system. The proposed system showed two major improvements. First, it can
collect other user’s ratings by RFR algorithm. So this helps users to make a decision
effectively. Second, it is robuster than the centralized recommender system using
clustering algorithms such as k-NN. When a malicious user tries to give wrong infor-
mation to other users on the system, in fact, there has not been a way to protect. The
proposed system, as shown in experiment Fig. 3(b), consists of P2P users can filter
this malicious rating out. As increasing a level, users on the FOAF network can get
filtered recommendation from their friends. Meanwhile, there still remain two major
defects. First, we need to find a way to keep a consistency of the system. Because P2P
is made of peer users, for the quality of performance, it needs as many users to rate
items for recommendation. Second, MAE in single level is still bigger than the cen-
tralized system. Therefore we also need to improve this problem in future.
