# COST Framework

## What is COST?

[COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)](https://www.cost.eu/) is a funding organization for research and innovation networks. These networks, called COST Actions, offer an open space for collaboration among scientists across Europe and beyond.

### Key Features

- **Bottom-up approach**: Scientists define research agendas
- **Networking focus**: Funding for meetings, not direct research
- **Inclusiveness**: Open to all research domains
- **Career development**: Support for early-career researchers

## COST Actions

COST Actions are collaborative networks lasting 4 years that:

- Connect researchers across Europe and internationally
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration
- Support early-career investigators
- Bridge academia and industry
- Influence policy through evidence-based research

## Funding Mechanism

COST provides funding for:

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Meetings** | Workshops, conferences, MC meetings |
| **Training Schools** | Intensive courses for early-career researchers |
| **STSMs** | Short-Term Scientific Missions (research visits) |
| **Virtual Mobility** | Remote collaboration grants |
| **ITC Grants** | Conference support for ITC country researchers |
| **Dissemination** | Publications, websites, outreach |

## ITC Countries

Inclusiveness Target Countries (ITCs) are COST member countries with lower research capacity. COST Actions are encouraged to include researchers from these countries.

### Current ITC Countries

Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine

### ITC Benefits

- Priority for STSM grants
- Dedicated ITC Conference Grants
- Representation targets in leadership

## CA19130 and COST

COST Action CA19130 exemplified COST values by:

!!! success "Inclusiveness"
    - 48 participating countries
    - Strong ITC representation (50%+ of participants)
    - Diverse disciplinary backgrounds

!!! info "Networking"
    - 52 meetings across Europe
    - 7 training schools
    - 27 STSMs enabling researcher exchange

!!! note "Impact"
    - 1,000+ collaborative publications
    - Policy influence on AI regulation
    - Lasting professional networks

## How to Participate

While CA19130 has concluded, new COST Actions are regularly launched. To participate:

1. **Join an existing Action**: Browse [open Actions](https://www.cost.eu/cost-actions/)
2. **Propose a new Action**: Submit during [Open Calls](https://www.cost.eu/funding/open-call/)
3. **Attend events**: Many Action events welcome external participants
