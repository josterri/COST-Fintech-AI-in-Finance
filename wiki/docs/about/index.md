# About COST Action CA19130

## Fintech and Artificial Intelligence in Finance

**Towards a transparent financial industry**

COST Action CA19130 (FinAI) was a four-year European research network (September 2020 - September 2024) dedicated to developing AI-based strategies for achieving transparency in finance. The Action brought together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers from 48 countries to address the challenges and opportunities of AI in the financial sector.

## Mission

Our mission was to create a pan-European research network that:

- Develops blended approaches combining traditional and novel AI techniques for financial transparency
- Investigates machine learning applications for fraud detection, risk management, and regulatory compliance
- Promotes explainable AI (XAI) to ensure financial decisions can be understood and trusted
- Creates open databases, frameworks, and best practices for the financial industry
