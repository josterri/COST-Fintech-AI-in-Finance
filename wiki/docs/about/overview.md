# Action Overview

## COST Action CA19130: FinAI

**Fintech and Artificial Intelligence in Finance - Towards a transparent financial industry**

### Background

The financial industry has undergone significant transformation with the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. However, the opacity of many AI systems poses challenges for regulation, trust, and adoption. COST Action CA19130 was established to address these challenges by building a pan-European research network focused on transparency in AI-driven finance.

### Scientific Scope

The Action brought together researchers from diverse disciplines including:

- **Computer Science**: Machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI
- **Finance**: Risk management, portfolio optimization, trading systems
- **Economics**: Market microstructure, behavioral finance, regulatory economics
- **Law**: Financial regulation, data protection, algorithmic accountability
- **Statistics**: Time series analysis, Bayesian methods, causal inference

### Research Approach

Our research followed a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Empirical Analysis**: Studying real-world applications of AI in finance
2. **Methodological Development**: Creating new techniques for model transparency
3. **Policy Research**: Informing regulatory frameworks for AI in finance
4. **Technology Transfer**: Bridging academia and industry practices

### Key Research Areas

| Area | Focus | Outcomes |
|------|-------|----------|
| Blockchain Transparency | Analyzing cryptocurrency markets, ICOs, DeFi | Fraud detection models, risk frameworks |
| Explainable AI | Making ML models interpretable | XAI toolkits, best practices |
| Investment Analytics | Performance evaluation, ESG | Stress testing frameworks |
| Risk Management | Operational risk, credit risk | Early warning systems |

### Network Activities
